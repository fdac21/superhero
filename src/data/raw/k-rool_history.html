<h3>K. Rool's History</h3>
K. Rool first appeared in the game Donkey Kong Country as the main antagonist and a boss. In the game, he and the Kremling Krew came to Donkey Kong Island one stormy night with the intention to steal Donkey Kong's fabled banana hoard. Sending several Kremlings to Donkey and Diddy Kong's treehouse to steal the precious bananas, the Kremlings encountered little resistance, as the only person guarding them was Diddy Kong. Diddy was actually able to defeat a handful of Kremlings, it was not until Klump and Krusha arrived that he was starting to struggle and eventually get overpowered, Klump and Krusha knocked Diddy aside and sealed him in a barrel, the Kremlings stole the Banana Hoard.<br><br>After venturing through the many regions of Donkey Kong Island, Donkey Kong and the released Diddy Kong defeated many of K. Rool's allies and reclaimed Donkey Kong's banana hoard, which were guarded by these lieutenants of the Kremling Krew.<br><br>Finally, the Kongs managed to reach the Gang-Plank Galleon, K. Rool's ship, where they faced the tyrannical crocodile in battle. K. Rool tried many tricks to defeat Donkey Kong and Diddy, such as using his crown as a boomerang, trying to ram them, stomp them, summoning a barrage of large cannonballs at them, and even faking his own death and displaying fake credits. In the end, Donkey Kong finally managed to beat K. Rool after a long difficult battle.<br><br>K. Rool returned in the Donkey Kong Country's semi-sequel on the Game Boy, Donkey Kong Land. In this game, Cranky Kong calls up K. Rool and demands he return to Donkey Kong Island and re-steal Donkey Kong's Banana Hoard. Cranky had made a bet earlier with Diddy and Donkey Kong that they could not reclaim the bananas on a handheld system. In this game, K. Rool is fought in a blimp above Big Ape City, where his attacks were mostly the same as his techniques in Donkey Kong Country: running, jumping and throwing his crown (although he did use a new, belly flop-like attack). Eventually, K. Rool is defeated again.<br><br>In the game Donkey Kong Country 2, K. Rool (under the alias of Kaptain K. Rool) manages to kidnap Donkey Kong and speeds him away to the home of the Kremlings, Crocodile Isle. He demands the Banana Hoard in return for Donkey Kong. After discovering that Donkey Kong has been kidnapped, Diddy Kong and his girlfriend, Dixie Kong, rush off to save him from Kaptain K. Rool. After venturing through the swampy Crocodile Isle, Diddy and Dixie managed to reach K. Rool's Keep, where Donkey Kong was supposedly being held. Finding Donkey Kong in a tower, the Kongs were about to rescue him when he was whisked away by K. Rool. In the Game Boy Advance version of Donkey Kong Country 2, K. Rool also sends the gigantic Kremling Kerozene to battle Diddy and Dixie Kong. After facing a few more obstacles, the Kongs managed to reach K. Rool's airship, The Flying Krock.<br><br>Here, Diddy and Dixie saw K. Rool in the midst of torturing Donkey Kong. Engaging K. Rool in battle, the Kremling king used a high-tech blunderbuss that could be used as a vacuum, also allowing K. Rool to move at high speeds, turn invisible, fire spiked Kannonballs and strange gases that could affect the Kongs in bizarre ways (e.g. reversing the game's controls, making the Kongs move extremely slow, and freezing them in place, etc.).<br><br>After a long battle, in which Diddy managed to do damage to K. Rool by hurling Kannonballs back into his blunderbuss (which would explode when clogged), Donkey Kong managed to break free of the bonds that held him and uppercut K. Rool out the front window of the Flying Krock. Crashing into the swampy water of Krem Quay, K. Rool managed to swim ashore to the Lost World.<br><br>By collecting enough Kremkoins for Klubba, Diddy and Dixie manage to follow K. Rool into the bowels of the Lost World and into Krocodile Kore. Here, they battled K. Rool in an ancient palace and, once again, K. Rool is defeated when a Kannonball is hurled into his blunderbuss. This time, however, instead of backfiring, the gun explodes, flinging K. Rool into a nearby geyser that supplied energy to Crocodile Isle. Due to K. Rool clogging the energy geyser, the pressure within it kept building up more and more until it exploded, taking the top of Crocodile Isle with it. The rest of the island sunk into the sea.<br><br>At the end of the game, a ship can be seen sailing away from the remains of the island and an ominous laugh can be heard as the ship sails over the horizon, telling the player that K. Rool survived the explosion, making way for another sequel.<br><br>In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, K. Rool's trophy states that Kaptain K. Rool is actually K. Rool's brother. However, this is confirmed to be a mistake by Nintendo, and is contradicted by Wrinkly trophy that explicitly implies they are the same character. K. Rool's true brother is K. Lumsy.<br><br>In the game Donkey Kong Land 2 for the Game Boy, Kaptain K. Rool, having risen Crocodile Isle from the sea, rebuilt parts of it and re-populated it, succeeds in capturing Donkey Kong again and demanded the Banana Hoard... again. With Donkey Kong once again kidnapped, Diddy Kong and Dixie Kong had to travel to the now-ravaged Crocodile Isle once again to save him and defeat the Kremling Krew.<br><br>Fought on the Flying Krock, Kaptain K. Rool's attack pattern in the game Donkey Kong Land 2 is a simplified version of his battle strategy in Donkey Kong Country 2: instead of shooting status-afflicting gas or using a vacuum attack, Kaptain K. Rool would simply shoot gusts of wind from his blunderbuss.<br><br>Once Kaptain K. Rool is defeated on the rebuilt Flying Krock and once Klubba is paid forty-seven Kremkoins, Kaptain K. Rool could be fought again in the Lost World. In the ruins of Krocodile Kore, Kaptain K. Rool would attack Diddy and Dixie Kong by blasting them with Kannonballs, both normal and spiked varieties. Eventually, Kaptain K. Rool would shoot a barrel, which must be jumped on to claim the Kannonball within. This Kannonball must be thrown at Kaptain K. Rool to defeat him and cause his blunderbuss to explode, flinging him into the geyser of Crocodile Kore, once again causing it to explode and send the entire island back down to the bottom of the ocean.<br><br>In the game Donkey Kong Country 3, K. Rool was seemingly replaced as Master of the Kremlings by KAOS: a robotic entity, created by K. Rool. He captures Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong, using their brainpower to control KAOS. Under KAOS' rule, the Kremling Krew proceeded to take over the Northern Kremisphere and imprison the Banana Bird Queen, as well as several of her children, the Banana Birds.<br><br>Eventually, after a long search for the recently vanished Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong, Dixie Kong and her cousin, Kiddy Kong, reached KAOS' base-of-operations, Kastle KAOS. Entering Kastle KAOS, Dixie and Kiddy encountered and began to battle KAOS, who was determined to destroy them.<br><br>It was only after their battle against KAOS that Dixie and Kiddy discovered that KAOS was nothing but a puppet leader controlled by K. Rool, who was under the moniker of Baron K. Roolenstein. After Dixie and Kiddy discovered him, Roolenstein began to battle the Kongs, using a helicopter pack on his back to fly and a remote control to send blasts of electricity across the floor of Kastle KAOS. In order to injure Roolenstein, Dixie and Kiddy would need to pull down on a particular pipe on the ceiling of Kastle KAOS, while avoiding Roolenstein and his electric beams. Pulling on this pipe would cause a barrel to appear, which would need to be thrown at Roolenstein. After being hit by multiple barrels by Dixie, Roolenstein would be defeated. But not before being zapped a few times by his electricity.<br><br>After Baron K. Roolenstein defeat, the body of KAOS would drop from the ceiling of Kastle KAOS and crash into the ground. Once on the ground, KAOS' body would release Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong, who had been kidnapped by Roolenstein to be used as living batteries for KAOS.<br><br>If Dixie and Kiddy manage to collect all the cogs in Krematoa and give them to Boomer, Roolenstein can be fought again. After Boomer's machine awakens the ancient volcano in Krematoa, a submarine, the Knautilus, will rise from beneath the volcano's lava. Inside this submarine, Roolenstein can be found and battled. In this battle, Roolenstein would simply remain in the back of his vessel, using electric beams and a fireball-launching cannon to attack Dixie and Kiddy from a distance. In order to hurt Roolenstein, Dixie and Kiddy would need to throw several Steel Kegs at him through the use of a teleportation device. After being hit multiple times by Dixie, Roolenstein would lose control of his helicopter pack and be left spinning out of control in his submarine.<br><br>If players manage to release the Banana Bird Queen from her imprisonment behind the Banana Bird Barrier, a brief cut-scene of Roolenstein riding away from the Northern Kremisphere in a hovercraft will be shown. As Roolenstein drives away, a giant egg, laid by the Banana Bird Queen and being ridden by Kiddy and Dixie, will fall on the Kremling king, trapping a perplexed Roolenstein inside.<br><br>In the game Donkey Kong Land III, Baron K. Roolenstein appears as the main antagonist and the Kremling Krew (as well as a rebuilt KAOS) as the secondary antagonists. Like in Donkey Kong Country 3, Baron K. Roolenstein can be fought by Dixie and Kiddy Kong in Kastle KAOS after KAOS is destroyed permanently. In battle, Baron K. Roolenstein would try to attack Dixie and Kiddy Kong by frying them with electric beams and by trying to fly into them using his helicopter pack. In order to harm Roolenstein, barrels would need to be thrown at his back by Dixie and Kiddy multiple times.<br><br>Baron K. Roolenstein could later be fought in Donkey Kong Land III in The Lost World. In this battle, he would attack by using electrical beams and by dropping bombs on Dixie and Kiddy Kong. Baron K. Roolenstein would need to be repeatedly hit with barrels in order to be defeated.<br><br>K. Rool returns in the game Donkey Kong 64, where K. Rool randomly appears one day on a Mobile Island Fortress. K. Rool had planned to blow up Donkey Kong Island with a weapon called the Blast-O-Matic. Fortunately, mobile fortress ends up crashing because of the incompetence of the drivers. In an attempt to distract Donkey Kong while he has the Blast-O-Matic prepared to shoot, K. Rool has several Kongs imprisoned. These are: Diddy Kong, Tiny Kong, Lanky Kong and Chunky Kong. He also steals Donkey Kong's Golden Banana Hoard.<br><br>K. Rool, along with his unnamed pet Klaptrap, appear in several of the game's cutscenes, watching the Kongs progress and chastising his own minions' (the bosses of the game) failures. A notable scene shows K. Rool demand that nobody leaves the Blast-O-Matic until it is repaired.<br><br>Eventually, K. Rool's henchmen succeed in repairing the Blast-O-Matic, just as the Kongs enter Hideout Helm. K. Rool demands that the weapon be fired, despite the warnings that, if it is not fully tested, then it could explode. After the Kongs permanently shut down K. Rool's mechanical island and the Blast-O-Matic laser weapon, K. Rool tries to escape in an airship, the King Kruiser II. Unfortunately for K. Rool, the airship ends up being knocked to the ground and destroyed by a freed K. Lumsy. Venturing inside the crashed vessel, the Kongs found a boxing arena filled with spectators and K. Rool, as his boxer alias King Krusha K. Rool, ready to fight. K. Rool will create multiple shockwaves by slamming the ground, throw his gloves as a boomerang, and uppercut the Kongs after charging at them. Engaging K. Rool in a bizarre series of battles- which include blasting out of barrels into K. Rool's face, dropping spot-lights on K. Rool, making him slip on banana peels, shrinking down and blasting his toes and (generally) pummeling him -the Kongs manage to claim victory.<br><br>After Chunky Kong delivers the final blow to K. Rool, a humorous cutscene is shown in which K. Rool gets back up after the fight and is about to attack Chunky from behind, but is distracted by Candy Kong, ending up being blasted over the horizon by Funky Kong and a bazooka that shoots out a boot. When K. Rool lands, it is in K. Lumsy's Island where he meets a very unhappy K. Lumsy, who proceeds to beat the Kremling king senseless in retaliation for locking him up.<br><br>Donkey Kong 64 also revealed that K. Rool truly is or had become a tyrant, even striking fear into his own Kremlings and other types of his goons such as Armydillo and Dogadon when they feared what he would do to them if he found out they lost to DK, Diddy, and Chunky. A Kasplat even tried to flee from K. Rool's island in fear of what he might do when he finds out that the Kongs and Snide are conspiring against him. He is shown also to have a really long tail (this is the first appearance he makes having a tail). K. Rool's depiction in this game changed as it goes on. He is initially depicted as cruel, merciless, and even menacing in the opening when he has a voice. In the cutscenes, his breath strongly bears a similarity to Darth Vader from the Star Wars franchise. However, as time goes on (especially towards the end of the game), K. Rool is depicted as far more comical and dim-witted.<br><br>One of K. Rool's more recent appearances was in the game DK: King of Swing, where he once again appears as the main antagonist. During the game, K. Rool steals all the DK Medals that were supposed to be rewards in the upcoming Jungle Jam competition and crowns himself king of the jungle in the process.<br><br>As the end boss of DK: King of Swing, K. Rool must be defeated in two battles.<br><br>In the first stage, K. Rool will summon a huge field of pegs, which Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong must race him through. K. Rool himself is quite fast, so climb as fast as you can.<br><br>In the second stage, if Donkey/Diddy succeeds in defeating K. Rool, he will promptly stutter by saying "Wait, Wait... That was just practice!" and challenge them to a battle on another peg field. In this part of the battle, K. Rool will attack in a similar fashing to the way the Kongs battle, he will charge up and rush at the Kong. The Kongs has to hit K. Rool four times to win, and can disrupt K. Rool/s charge attack by charging at him. Defeated again, K. Rool reliquishes a gold medal, finally vanquished. Donkey Kong/Diddy Kong takes K. Rool's hovercraft as the K. Kruizer III is destroyed and falls from the sky.<br><br>K. Rool is also playable in DK: King of Swing's Jungle Jam mode, where he is the largest playable character and the most powerful. His partner is, oddly, Bubbles, the hero of the game Clu Clu Land. This was the first time K. Rool was playable in a game.<br><br>In the game DK: Jungle Climber, K. Rool once again takes the role as the main antagonist. He is first encountered atop Sun Sun Island, where he and his entourage of four (at first five) Kritters steal the five Crystal Bananas from the banana alien Xananab with plans to take over the world. When King K. Rool and his henchmen see Donkey, Diddy, and Cranky Kong heading their way, they quickly flee the scene using a dimensional portal device known as a Spirowarp.<br><br>On the Lost Island, K. Rool is shocked to see Donkey Kong confronting him for the Crystal Bananas with Xananab before having one of his Kritters deal with them using one of the stolen Crystal Bananas to turn into Toyface as he escapes from Toybox and depart to the Ghost Island. In the Panic Factory, K. Rool is met again by his pursuing enemies and has another Kritter battle them using a Crystal Banana along with his incomplete Mega AMP before fleeing to Kremling Dock on Chill 'n' Char Island. Anticipating another confrontation, K. Rool lays a trap for the Donkey Kong, Diddy, Cranky, and Xananab. Once they fall into the chasm, a third Kritter enters after them, powering up with the Crystal Banana and morphing into a dragon. Just as Donkey Kong escapes the caverns, King K. Rool unveils the King Kruizer IV. The king reveals how he intends to use the spaceship and the Crystal Bananas to conquer the universe, starting with Xananab's home planet, Planet Plantean, before flying away.<br><br>K. Rool is stunned to see the heroes managed to board the ship before having his fiinal Kritter subordinate use a fully completed Mega AMP to destroy them. Donkey still triumphs and claims the fourth Crystal Banana. Cornered, K. Rool feigns an attempt to fight, abandoning the King Kruizer IV and flees through a wormhole. Traversing through the dimensions of the Glass Labyrinth and Toybox, K. Rool arrives on Planet Plantean though the quartet aren't far behind and search the village for him.<br><br>Confronted for the final time, K. Rool will battle Donkey Kong, attacking by jumping at him, charging into him and throwing exploding, spiked balls. Once K. Rool is defeated in this battle by hitting him four times, he will refuse to give up, and use the last Crystal Banana in his possession to turn monstrous in size and become even more powerful.<br><br>In his new form, K. Rool will gain a new set of attacks. He can exhale fireballs and exploding mines from his mouth, summoning meteors to crush the Kongs, unleash gales of wind to blow the Kongs and trying to crush the Kongs with his claws. In this form, K. Rool's only vulnerable spot is his face, which, when hit five times, will deplete K. Rool's health, turning him back to normal and leaving him unconscious, expelling the Crystal Banana from him. K. Rool is last seen in DK: Jungle Climber being taken back to his and the Kong's home planet, being dragged through space by a rope attached to the back of a Banana Spaceship.<br><br>In the racing game Donkey Kong Barrel Blast, K. Rool makes an appearance as a secret playable character. Unlike the other racers, who use strapped-on barrel rockets, K. Rool rides in a vehicle resembling a rocket-powered barrel (though he controls it similarly by banging on the sides). He uses his claw as an attack. He is unlocked by clearing Challenge 31 of Candy's Challenges. His main rival in the game is Cranky Kong, who has the same high boost, speed, and agility as him. </div>

<p>
The Superhero Database Classification number, or SHDB Class, is a number that represents the overall 'power' of a character. All traits of a character are used for calculating the Classification.
</p>
<h5>What it DOESN'T mean</h5>
<p>
This doesn't mean that a higher class would always beat a lower class character. But the bigger the difference in Class is, the more obvious it is who'll win in a fight.
</p>
<h5>How is this calculated</h5>
<pre class="footnote">( INT^1.3 + (STR*0.5 )^2 + (SPE*0.5)^2 + DUR^1.6 + (POW + (SPS*SPL))^2 + COM^1.8 ) ^ TIER</pre>
<h6>Super Power Score and Level</h6>
<p>Every Super Power has a score (SPS) that is used to calculate the Class. Each Super Power also has 3 levels (SPL). The level is set when connecting that Super Power to a character. The level determines the final score, of the Super Power, being used in the calculation.
