<h3>Hit's History</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
Born over 1000 years ago, Hit has been an assassin for a very long time. He is famous for his highly efficient work at his job as all of his past assassinations were successfully completed. His signature for completing each assignment is to quietly kill the target in a single strike.<br><br><h4>Universe 6 Saga</h4>
Hit is selected by Vados to be part of Team Universe 6 in order to fight in the Tournament of Destroyers against Team Universe 7. In return for joining the team, Hit is promised Champa's Hexahedron if he wins the tournament. On the day of the tournament, Hit attends the Nameless Planet with his fellow fighters: Cabba, Frost, Botamo, and Auta Magetta. Hit passes the written exam required to participate in the tournament. When the tournament begins, Hit is not interested in the other matches, as he sits back with his eyes closed and arms crossed during the first match between Goku and Botamo. Goku defeats Botamo easily by throwing him out of the ring. The next competitor for Goku is Frost. When Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan against Frost, Hit opens one of his eyes and looks at Goku for a moment and then closes them once again. Frost manages to beat Goku with poison which was against the rules, but nobody notices except for Jaco. He advances to the next match against Piccolo, where he again uses poison, but this time Jaco reports it to the referee and gets Frost disqualified. However, Vegeta didn't want Frost to be disqualified so he could beat him himself, and so, Piccolo gives up. Hit still ignores the events occurring around him and continues to have his eyes closed, paying absolutely no interest in the matches.<br><br>After Vegeta defeats Frost due to a ring out, Frost is outside of the barrier of the tournament. Hit notices Frost sneaking away and follows him. It turns out that Frost is trying to hijack Champa's cube and steal the treasure Hit was promised if he wins. Hit confronts Frost and stops him in mid-action. Frost is shocked over seeing him, but also curious if the legendary assassin was sent by Champa or even by a survivor from a planet that he destroyed. Hit attacks Frost with a mysterious technique that stuns him. Hit restates that when he wins the tournament, Champa will reward him the Hexahedron. He then goes back to the tournament grounds and carries Frost along with him.<br><br>Hit mostly remains uninterested during Vegeta and Cabba's match, only briefly opening his eyes as Vegeta transforms into a Super Saiyan Blue. He then shifts his eyes over to Goku on the other side of the arena, but then quickly closes his eyes. Once Vegeta defeats Cabba, Hit, being the final competitor for Team Universe 6, leaps into the ring for his match. For the majority of the battle, Hit attacks Vegeta in his vitals while using his Time-Skip, much to the confusion of everyone in the arena, including Vegeta. Hit then tells Vegeta that he should surrender. After his first barrage of attacks on Vegeta, Hit puts his hands in his pockets and looks down on Vegeta, as if to tell him that he is failing in all of his attempts of countering. During the battle, Vegeta notes that the light attacks he uses are his main weakness, and shouts to Hit that he will beat him with a head on attack, to which Hit counters with a blow to the abdomen. Vegeta then faints from the injuries he sustained. Hit then asks the referee what he should do if killing is illegal, which the referee confirms, as Vegeta couldn't surrender while unconscious. The referee then declares Hit the winner. Goku returns in the tournament for his match against Hit, since being illegally taken out by Frost.<br><br>As the bell is rung, Goku then bows to Hit, to which Hit is genuinely surprised. Hit then asks Goku why he does not transform, and Goku responds by saying that it uses a lot of stamina, so he will save it for later in the match. Goku tells Hit that he will wait to transform until he figures out a way to beat him. Hit responds by saying how incredibly young and naive Goku must be to reveal his plan so easily. The fight then begins, with Goku getting a firm kick to the abdomen by Hit's attack. After a few failed attempts to land a blow on him, Goku is still unable to counter Hit's attacks. Hit then tells Goku that his attempts are futile, and that no matter how strong he is, if he continues to get hit in his vitals, he will die, and that he should surrender. Goku tells Hit he won't surrender, since he figured out a way to counter his attacks. Goku then stances himself, and charges at Hit, and for the first time, Goku is able to block Hit's Time-Skip attack. Goku then uses the opportunity and swipes at Hit, causing him to bleed. Hit is shocked, but then dismisses the wound as a fluke. Goku then attacks Hit two more times and is able to deflect his counterattacks. He manages to land a kick on Hit, which Hit manages to block in the last second, with Hit being genuinely surprised. Goku reveals that since his Time-Skip lasts one-tenth of a second, Goku easily was able to predict Hit's moves after the technique was used.<br><br>Hit then takes his hands out of his pockets, realizing that he will have to fight seriously, and Goku states he will use his full power as well, transforming into a Super Saiyan Blue in the anime and a normal Super Saiyan in the manga. In the manga the two continue to fight, and though Goku has the advantage in power he is troubled by Hit's Time-Skip as constantly predicting his attack pattern caused his energy to drain at an accelerated rate. In response, Goku transforms further into a Super Saiyan God.<br><br>Hit then uses his full power - which he notes will last for less than a minute due to his lack of having to use it. The two are equal until Goku then transforms to Super Saiyan Blue and starts attacking Hit. Hit then retaliates with his Time-Skip but to no avail. Goku then continues to outmatch Hit and in the manga forfeits when he realizes that the fight is not fair due to the rules.<br><br>In the anime after Goku kicks Hit, Hit begins to shout and starts to unleash his ki, pretending to raise his power level but simply mimicking how Goku powered up. Just as Goku is about to land a blow to Hit, he uses his improved Time-Skip and lands a very powerful blow to Goku's abdomen, which causes Goku to temporarily collapse to the ground from pain. Hit asks the referee once again if killing is allowed, to which the referee says no once again, and just as Hit is about to be declared the winner, Goku states that he is alright, and gets up once again. Goku then says that he needs to use his new technique, which he intended to use against Beerus, and only had a ten percent chance of working. Goku then starts powering up with a red glow around his normal Super Saiyan Blue aura.<br><br>After sufficiently powering up, Goku reveals his trump card: the Kaio-ken, and provides a short explanation of the technique to Hit. Goku and Hit then collide, with Hit trying to attack Goku with his time-skip. Goku counters Hit's attack despite being mid Time-Skip, much to the latter's surprise, explaining his power has surpassed Hit's time-skip. Goku then feels his body decreasing in power and fires a Kamehameha, which Hit appears to be struggling to fight against. The energy released from both fighters causes the dome to begin to crack and forces Whis and Vados to protect the audience and restore the dome. When the smoke clears both fighters are still on the arena, and Hit reveals that while the Kamehameha was being fired, he increased his time skip further and avoided being captured in its blast.<br><br>Hit then launches a volley of attacks at Goku with his Time-Skip. As Goku falls, appearing to be defeated, he powers up again and lands a blow to Hit. Both fighters are seen kneeling as Goku's strength and physical body are going into a worse condition. Goku then asks Beerus to allow for killing in the tournament, since Goku believes that Hit's true strength lies in when he is forced to kill others. Beerus objects to this, but Champa says the fight showed such a good display of sportsmanship, and to allow killing in the tournament. Beerus objects, saying it is only to help Champa's team, and Champa objects saying that Goku suggested this in the first place. As both complain, Goku notes how selfish both are, and Hit agrees by saying they think the fighters are just pawns in their game. Goku then rebels against Champa and Beerus by leaping outside of the ring, making Hit the winner.<br><br>Monaka is the next and final contestant for Team Universe 7. After Monaka enters the ring, Champa quickly begins the final match. Hit notices that Monaka is shaking. Monaka attempts to attack Hit but Hit is unfazed by his attack. After this, Hit dramatically screams and flies out of the ring, purposely losing the match. While Goku is congratulated by his friends, Hit says that the two of them are now even, as he returns to his platform. Hit then tells Vados and Champa that he no longer has interest in the Hexahedron and commands to be taken home.<br><br>Champa is then filled with anger and prepares a ki ball, preparing to kill Hit. Champa expresses his frustration with Hit for continuously disobeying his orders and purposely losing the last round, so he will not allow Hit to leave alive. Cabba attempts to reason with Champa but does not succeed, with Champa saying how all of the fighters embarrassed and humiliated him with their pathetic fights. While Champa attempts to kill Hit and his teammates, Vados alerts Champa that Zeno is present in the ring. Thanks to Zeno scaring Champa and Beerus, all the members of Team Universe 6 were able to survive. Before leaving for their respective universes, Hit and Goku shared a handshake, promising to fight each other again one day.<br><br><h4>"Future" Trunks Saga</h4>
Hit makes a cameo appearance during the "Future" Trunks Saga, where Gowasu and Zamasu were watching footage of his match against Super Saiyan Blue Goku during the Tournament of Destroyers.<br><br>Hit receives an assignment to eliminate a mob boss in Universe 6, easily accomplishing his task without anyone knowing thanks to his Time-Skip. After disposing of the mob boss's necklace, he checks his assignment device to find out who his next target is, and is noticeably excited to see that it is Goku, crushing the device before heading to Universe 7 (completely unaware that it was Goku who asked Whis, who then asked Vados to hire Hit in order for Goku to fight Hit at his fullest, deadliest level).<br><br>Hit meets up with Goku, and tells him that his attacks will no longer work on him. Hit's body emits a purple outline when Goku charges towards him and throws a flurry of punches and kicks that just go through him, like he was not there. A shocked Goku then tries to fire a ki blast, but Hit throws a punch which creates a shockwave that caves in Goku's chest, stopping his heart. As Goku collapses to the ground dying, Hit flies up into the air but stops and heads back to finish Goku after learning that he is still alive due to a ki blast that Goku had fired earlier and follows Goku into a forest.<br><br>Here, Goku begins to learn how Hit's assassination techniques are working and on the third try is finally able to completely block and stop them and was able to scratch Hit, to which Hit isn't surprised but rather exited, and he is enjoying his fight with Goku. After Vados reveals that Hit actually stores up the time he skips and is able to use this to move around in pocket dimensions to appear in multiple places at once. Goku having figured this out already powers up to maximum which causes the pocket dimension that Hit goes into to shatter, revealing where Hit actually is to Goku. Hit attempts to pull it back together but was unable to do so and is hit by Goku's God Kamehameha head-on, and both of them collapse out of exhaustion. Afterwards, Hit learns that Goku was the one who hired him to kill him which initially confused Hit who admits Goku is more complex then he is able to comprehend and asks Goku if there was a time limit to complete his mission, which Goku denies. Hit takes his leave after claiming there were too many witnesses and smiles as he told Goku he would take his time to kill him and should watch his back.<br><br><h4>Universe Survival Saga</h4>
In the anime, Hit tracks down Frost to recruit him for the tournament, but the latter mistakes it for an assassination attempt and attacks him. After a brief scuffle, Hit defeats Frost but instead of killing him, he spares his life and compliments his improved skill. Hit then recruits Frost but makes him lose the poison tip on his tail and knees, at the risk of being erased.<br><br>After arriving at the tournament arena Hit talks with Goku. In the manga Hit states that he has gotten stronger than before and will not lose to Goku in the same way he did last time.<br><br>In the anime, as the tournament began, Hit, alongside Basil, stopped Narirama from spinning around the stage by stomping on his extendable arms. After Universe 9 was erased by Zeno and Future Zeno, Hit went back to fighting in the tournament and was about to fight Vegeta again until he was blocked by Botamo, who was walking towards the Saiyans with him at the time. Hit knocks Narirama out of the ring with a single flick using a Time-skip. Hit saves Caulifla from getting caught in the crossfire after Kale turns into her Legendary Super Saiyan form. Hit is next seen more concerned about Kale disqualifying herself by killing someone than of his own safety. After Jiren knocks Kale out, Hit prepares himself to hold the Pride Trooper off to give Caulifla and Kale some time to escape. However, Goku appears and distracts Jiren, as Hit uses this as an opportunity to tell Caulifla to carry Kale away allowing them to perform a tactical retreat.<br><br>In the manga, Hit encounters Jiren five minutes into the tournament. Like with his prior battle with Super Saiyan Blue Goku, Hit's Time-Skip proves ineffective against Jiren and he is quickly knocked down. Goku, having transformed into Perfected Super Saiyan Blue, arrives to help Hit but he too proves no match for Jiren, as Jiren is about to knock Goku off the edge, Hit knocks Jiren away with a surprise kick, surprising Goku who thought Hit could not fight without Time-Skip. Hit removes the lower part of his coat, explaining he no longer relies on his Time-Skip. Now acting as a true fighter Hit once again engages Jiren but still proves unable to budge him, Goku takes part in the battle but still the two warriors prove no match as Jiren handles them with ease, not changing his expression. Hit reveals to Goku that he has a new special technique which he can only use once: Time Lag, he requests that Goku aid him in defeating Jiren when he uses the technique, but Goku refuses, saying he will beat Jiren on his own by achieving a power greater than Super Saiyan Blue. Hit still opts to fight anyway, he hits Jiren with the Time Lag, slowing his movements and allowing Hit to seemingly gain an advantage over him, Hit pushes Jiren back to the edge of the arena, however as they reach the edge Goku realizes that it's a trap and that Jiren was simply baiting Hit to the edge, Goku tries to warn Hit, however he is too late and Jiren suddenly speeds up, uppercutting Hit out of the arena, eliminating him with a single blow. Hit arrives in the stands, regretting that he was not strong enough to defeat Jiren.<br><br>In the anime, Hit then confronted Dyspo. Hit attempts to use his Time Skip but was countered by Dyspo. Hit tries again and is once again countered. Hit realizes that Dyspo is listening to his muscles as they tense up for his Time Skip. Hit tries his Time Skip for a third time and is knocked back and mocked by Dyspo. Hit then attacks him normally and K'nsi believes it to be an easy victory. However, Jiren looks on concerned for Dyspo and Top mentions Hit is actually dodging the major blows and allowing himself to be hit sometimes. Top realizes Hit is up to something and asks K'nsi to save Dyspo. At this time Hit is knocked back to the edge of the ring and Dyspo charges believing he has beaten him but Hit successfully uses hit Time Skip to move and Dyspo falls from the ring but is saved from being eliminated by K'nsi, who says they will fight together.<br><br>Hit, not impressed, tells them to bring it. Hit begins to beat back Dyspo again, but K'nsi holds him with his Energy Threads so Dyspo can get in his hits with no resistance. Caulifla, angered at the Pride Troopers for using such tactics begins to go and help but instead Super Saiyan God Goku arrives and stops Dyspo. Goku engages Dyspo while Hit deals with K'nsi. K'nsi prepared his bombs, but Hit simply used his Flash Crush Fist and nearly kills K'nsi with it, much to his horror. Hit then switches with Goku and goes back after Dyspo and actually lands a massive blow to Dyspo. Shocked, Hit explains he flexed and tensed the muscles he uses for his Time Skip to open him up so he could hit him, much to Dyspo's shock. Hit then overwhelms K'nsi, and then Dyspo. Meanwhile, K'nsi pulls himself out of the rubble after Goku punched him through some debris and saves Dyspo. As he tried to sacrifice himself by taking the assassin down with him, Hit counters by using his newly enhanced Time Skip to get behind him and punch him clear out of the ring, eliminating him. Dyspo runs off later. Hit and Goku then come face to face, promising to settle things between them later on.<br><br>In the anime, further on in the tournament, Hit, alongside the other fighters, watches Goku in his Ultra Instinct Omen state combat Jiren's own strength. He saves Goku from further damage by Jiren when the former loses hold of his new form and is defeated by the latter's Power Impact, although Jiren easily catches Hit's punch. Hit and Jiren begin their battle, though Jiren blocks all of Hit's attacks and manages to counter his Time-Skip, much to Hit and Champa's shock. Hit is then eventually cornered by Jiren and is seemingly defeated. However, Hit reveals he has been allowing himself to be hit to study Jiren's style and knows enough to land one major blow to beat him. Hit finally lands an attack on Jiren, who is stunned that he was almost knocked out of the ring. Hit reveals his attack has another purpose and paralyzes Jiren. However, seeing that he can't hold Jiren much longer, who is still able to move his body, Hit goes for a final attack. But, Jiren manages to stop it with his barrier and escape from the paralysis.<br><br>Hit is then sent flying out of the ring by Jiren's Power Impact. There, Champa tells Hit that he did a good job and his actions would help the other warriors from Universe 6. The tournament reaches it's halfway point as Hit is defeated. Hit watches in silence as his remaining teammates battle for the survival of their universe. He is eventually erased from existence with the rest of Universe 6 after Saonel and Pilina are eliminated by Gohan and Piccolo.<br><br>Hit is later revived with his universe when Android 17 uses the Super Dragon Balls to resurrect all of the universes that were erased. </div>

<p>
The Superhero Database Classification number, or SHDB Class, is a number that represents the overall 'power' of a character. All traits of a character are used for calculating the Classification.
</p>
<h5>What it DOESN'T mean</h5>
<p>
This doesn't mean that a higher class would always beat a lower class character. But the bigger the difference in Class is, the more obvious it is who'll win in a fight.
</p>
<h5>How is this calculated</h5>
<pre class="footnote">( INT^1.3 + (STR*0.5 )^2 + (SPE*0.5)^2 + DUR^1.6 + (POW + (SPS*SPL))^2 + COM^1.8 ) ^ TIER</pre>

<h6>Super Power Score and Level</h6>
<p>Every Super Power has a score (SPS) that is used to calculate the Class. Each Super Power also has 3 levels (SPL). The level is set when connecting that Super Power to a character. The level determines the final score, of the Super Power, being used in the calculation.
