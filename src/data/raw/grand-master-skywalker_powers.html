<h3>Grand Master Skywalker's powers and abilities</h3>
<h4>Lightsaber abilities</h4>
Though Luke received little training, he became an exceptionally skilled Jedi in combat, making him one of the most powerful Jedi to ever live. Without a master, it was his natural and unparalleled aptitude that contributed in the impossible advancement of his skills. On Bespin, Luke revealed that he was an extraordinarily gifted duelist after only one brief session with Obi-Wan Kenobi, and later, Yoda. On board the second Death Star, Luke mirrored Darth Vader's own Form V technique and responded with his own furious demonstration of Form V's raw power. Luke Skywalker's use of Form V is probably as much instinctive as trained, leaving observing swordsmen, such as Darth Sidious, astonished at such instantaneous learning in a lightsaber duel. Ultimately, Luke was able to duel Vader on an even footing, and defeated the experienced Dark Lord. However, Luke's particular form of lightsaber combat may in the end be something entirely new, with traces of Form III, Form IV and Form V mixed together with his own techniques. After the fateful duel, however, Luke also studied some lightsaber techniques from Kenobi's journal and greatly advanced his abilities.<br><br>As Grand Master, Luke particularly took the time to write in the margins noting how compassion was a key element to mastering Form V, indicating he had some degree of knowledge of the finer points in the Form as of at least that point. He also mastered the strong style, a form of lightsaber combat that resembles Djem So that is used in the New Jedi Order. Luke also revealed having knowledge and skill in the use of Ataru. Skywalker learned the form from Yoda and passed it on to his students, teaching them to embrace it not as a weapon of first use, but to use both their weapon and their body in practicing Ataru. Luke Skywalker was known to possess some skill in Soresu, using it to deflect blaster bolts.<br><br>In the fight against Darth Sidious, during Operation Shadow Hand, he rebelled against the reborn Emperor and despite losing initially, Luke again engaged Sidious in a final duel. The fight was so intense that Leia could hardly see the movements of Luke as he engaged the Emperor, but she sensed waves of power generating from them—dark from the Emperor, and light from Luke. Luke took the upper hand and sliced off the Emperor's hand with cho mai. Darth Sidious, whose lightsaber prowess rivaled that of Yoda's, laid defeated.<br><br>Luke was also able to display his amazing dueling skills with dual blades during the Yuuzhan Vong War. When his nephew, Jacen Solo, was captured by the Yuuzhan Vong Luke wielded his own blade, as well as Jacen's, and easily defeated three Yuuzhan Vong Warriors, before freeing Jacen. Later in the Yuuzhan Vong War, Luke participated in the Battle of Artorias and defeated over a dozen Yuuzhan Vong Warriors. Luke's abilities with a lightsaber allowed him to fight his way through countless Yuuzhan Vong warriors in the Sacred Precinct. After defeating numerous Yuuzhan Vong warriors in Shimrra's Citadel, Luke defeated more than five Slayers; while Kyp Durron, one of the most powerful Jedi of his time, could not best the Slayers who were exposed to Alpha Red. Afterward, Luke slew Supreme Overlord Shimrra Jamaane, who was stated to be the best warrior of the Yuuzhan Vong, despite being injured by the poison of the Scepter of Power.<br><br>Later into the war, Luke led the Jedi against Jacen and faked his death to infiltrate the Anakin Solo. Luke saw Jacen, who was unknown to Luke at this point the Sith Lord Darth Caedus, torturing his son Ben. Luke leaped at Jacen and the two engaged in a prolonged lightsaber duel, during which both duelists suffered severe injuries. Luke eventually defeated his nephew with the intervention of Ben, but he spared him so his son would not fall to the dark side.<br><br>During the Battle of Tenupe, Luke dueled Raynar Thul, who at the time could draw on the Force energy of every single nest member and Joiner, and was able to defeat him by cutting off his dominant hand. Before he could get Raynar to surrender he was attacked by the Queen of the Dark Nest, Lomi Plo. Although Lomi Plo wielded two lightsabers, Luke was still able to block her attacks and kill her by slicing her into four pieces, thus destroying the Dark Nest and ending the Swarm War.<br><br>During Luke's exile, the Lost Tribe of Sith sent out a strike team to kill the Jedi Grand Master. Despite being outnumbered, Luke along side Ben, fought his way through approximately fifteen Sith until only the Sith Lady, Olaris Rhea, and her apprentice, Vestara Khai, remained. Luke dueled the both of them and killed Olaris, only allowing Vestara to escape so he could track her with a Blood Trail.<br><br>While looking for the Sith on Dromund Kaas Luke, Ben, Vestara, and Jaina Solo were attacked by 10 Sith sabers led by Gavar Khai. Despite being outnumbered and the Sith powered by Dromund Kaas' dark side nexus, the Jedi and Vestara fought them. Luke and Jaina fought back to back, bonded by the Force, in perfect harmony and defeated six attacking Sith. This fight, among other things, displayed that Luke had great skill in working in unison with other combatants.<br><br><h4>Force powers</h4>
Skywalker was skilled in a great number of Force powers, giving him the Force potential to become what his father was supposed to become—the Force potential of the Chosen One. Luke's first conscious use of the Force was to locate a lost screwdriver under a couch, when he was only 6 years old.<br><br>During the Battle of Yavin, Luke managed to destroy the first Death Star by letting the Force tell him when to fire his proton torpedoes, while traveling at very high speeds, not knowing the distance to the port, and having no previous knowledge of proton torpedoes and their capabilities. Astonishingly, Luke only had little training with the Force at the time.<br><br>Only a short time after being given a lightsaber by Obi-Wan, Luke was able to instinctively block several blaster bolts fired in rapid succession by a remote, despite his lack of prolonged formal training. Without any guidance except a handbook left by Obi-Wan Kenobi, Luke Skywalker successfully built his first lightsaber, merely three years after he was first introduced to the Force, and undergoing formal training for less than a year. Further testament to this was shown when Luke was able to successfully Mind trick a stormtrooper into disregarding his concealed lightsaber, roughly two months after he had first seen Ben Kenobi perform it.<br><br>The Grand Master was also frighteningly proficient in the more personal applications of the Force. After being fatally wounded in the battle between the Singing Mountain Clan and the Nightsisters, Luke was able to instinctively heal himself in the span of mere hours. Luke's proficiency in Force speed allowed him to increase the speed of his lightsaber strikes, as seen during his duels with Yuuzhan Vong Supreme Overlord Shimrra Jamaane and UnuThul. With guidance from the voice of Ben Kenobi, Luke gave in to the Force and found that time seemed to slow down considerably, allowing him fight with dramatically enhanced reflexes. Luke describes the feeling as if he didn't feel in control of the power and instead felt that it was the Force guiding his actions. Luke was also skilled in the use of Force Jump, using it to avoid being frozen in carbonite during his duel with Darth Vader. Likewise, Luke safely landed himself and Isolder from a free fall drop from orbit with the Force.<br><br>Luke's skill with telekinesis was as remarkable as it was overwhelming. In the middle of a massive midday meal food fight at the Jedi Praxeum's mess hall, Luke instantly froze every morsel, drop and item, solid and liquid in midair as if trapped in time, only falling after Luke had consciously released everything within the room. Luke was able to knock down an AT-AT by pressing against it with the Force; he also absorbed the initial cannon blasts from the AT-AT, before deflecting the rest with his lightsaber. In combat, Luke was able to destroy a group of hot-wired battle droids just by waving his hand, subtly displacing their master servos and causing the self-destruction of the group of droids. This Force power was first manifested by Jedi Master Arca Jeth during the Great Droid Revolution. Even then, with proper instruction, it was a difficult power to master. However, this power apparently came naturally to Luke. Similarly, during the Black Fleet Crisis, Luke used the Force to rebuild Darth Vader's old fortress on Coruscant. Luke would later use the Force to crush the rebuilt fortress of Darth Vader to rubble, shattering the building piece by piece and throwing it into the oceans of Coruscant. During the Battle of Dantooine during the Yuuzhan Vong War, Luke managed to telekinetically sustain a black hole while simultaneously flinging the dovin basals into it.<br><br>In arguably the greatest fight of his life, Luke Skywalker walked Beyond shadows and had a final duel with Abeloth. Using his bare hands and offensive Force exertisons, Luke was able to temporarily destroy the dark side entity, with help from Darth Krayt, who also attacked Luke as well halfway through, and attempted to drain him.<br><br>Among other Force powers Luke had under his disposal, he was particularly skilled in mental manipulation. During the Eye of Palpatine incident, Luke subconsciously used his Force powers to overcome a particularly vicious form of brainwashing, able to easily siphon all the information he was seeking. While searching for the kidnapped Solo children, Luke used the Force to create an illusion over his face in order to disguise his identity. After the Black Fleet Crisis, with new found knowledge from the White Current, Luke removed the Teljkon Vagabond from view using the Force. During the Death Seed Plague, Luke used the Force to communicate with the sentient crystals Tsils; despite the fact that the more dissimilar the type of mind, the more difficult it is to communicate with via the Force. Toward the end of the Swarm War, Luke used the Force to call all the Jedi across the galaxy to Ossus to make the announcement of him taking on the role as Grand Master of the Jedi Order and to issue his views about the role of the Order to his Jedi.<br><br>Befitting his title as Grand Master, Luke also mastered a plethora of rare and difficult Force powers. While he was re-creating the Jedi Order and was searching for potential candidates, he walked on lava while still throbbing with the Force after defeating a Fireworm living in the lava just moments before. Luke's performance impressed Gantoris so much that he decided to become Luke's apprentice. During the Battle of the Jedi Praxeum Luke used the Force to bolster his students engaged in battle. During the Kueller crisis, Luke prepared himself for death in such a way that he would become a Force ghost, showing that he could utilize such a rare and potent skill. In the years before the Yuuzhan Vong War, Luke also trained to overcome the Force-Blindness caused by Ysalamiri. During the early days of the Dark Nest Crisis, Luke used the Force to generate a physical copy of the Jade Shadow to fool the attacking dartships. This usage of the Force was so extreme, Luke burnt out and his face was temporarily sunken and shriveled like Palpatine's. A year later. Luke applied the same trick on the DR919a, but by then Luke already mastered the technique and would no longer burn out.<br><br>While battling UnuThul, Luke was able to resist the combined Force power of the Colony and triumph. When UnuThul attempted to Force Push the Grand Master, Luke rooted himself with the Force so strongly that it was said that he had become the very essence of the immovable object, and that not even the black hole at the center of the galaxy could move him.<br><br>During the Battle of Kashyyyk, Luke shut his presence down after being fired upon by Jaina to make it seem like he died. Later, while Ben was in the Embrace of Pain, Jacen gave Ben back his ability to sense the Force temporarily and Ben felt the life force of his father and realized Luke was shutting himself down to everyone except Ben, something no other Jedi had been able to do. Right before the Battle of Fondor, Luke made Caedus "see" a fleet of ships, causing him to panic in front of his navy. Luke directed it right at Caedus in general, to show him what he could do and also to scare Caedus. Luke revealed to Jaina Solo that he was capable of perceiving Shatterpoints, a very rare Force ability, and taught this ability to Jaina.<br><br>During the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar, Luke had shown himself capable of consciously reaching a state of Oneness. He was described as a maelstrom of luminous Force energy, against which there was no shelter. So calm and focused was he that his actions were not interrupted by any thought. Luke merged with the Force to such a degree that the Jedi Master did not seem to be there, physically or as an individual personality. Luke's control over his lightsaber blade was so great that he was said to might as well have been wielding ten, or twenty lightsabers against the Vong. The Solo twins were astounded seeing their uncle in such a state. Luke used a powerful and unique ability of the Force related to his signature green Electric Judgment in the chamber of Shimrra Jamaane. This technique had been described to look like "green sparks," which instantly killed the Slayers.<br><br>In 43.5 ABY, Skywalker learned the "lightning-rod" technique Ayna-seff, which he use to safely travel through the Kathol Rift. After spending time with the Aing-Tii, Luke was taught the Fold space ability which allowed him to teleport objects vast distances. During the battle in the Fallanassi village, when Abeloth had Luke in a deadly embrace, Luke opened himself to the Force as much as possible, drawing on his love for his son Ben, his lost wife Mara, and the entire Jedi Order. The Light Side rushed into him, his cells began to burst with power and his skin gave off a golden glow. Luke's power apparently harmed Abeloth and Luke seized the moment by using the Force to bring down a ceiling beam onto Abeloth, then seemingly killed her with his lightsaber. While looking for Abeloth on Nam Chorios, Luke also mastered mnemotherapy.<br><br>By 45 ABY, Luke had great resilience in Force duels, able to break a powerful Force grip on his neck, and take a full blast of Force lightning to the torso.<br><br>During his duel with the Columi Qresh brothers, Luke dispensed powerful blasts of Force energy that manifested itself as golden flame. He also experienced an epiphany, in which he came to a conclusion that the light side is just as important to the Force as the dark, and as a whole their is only the Force, with everything else just a necessary push and pull, circle of life.<br><br>Upon death, Luke was able to retain his consciousness in the Netherworld of the Force, and could henceforth manifest himself in spirit form.<br><br><h4>Other abilities</h4>
Luke applied the very opposite of Dun Möch on board the second Death Star by infusing love into Darth Vader's heart through spoken words. The young Jedi was successful—Anakin Skywalker ultimately redeemed himself and brought balance to the Force.<br><br>Like his father, Luke was an expert pilot, being the person who was responsible for destroying the first Death Star and managing to evade Darth Vader himself (albeit with help from Han Solo). He also landed a crashing Imperial Star Destroyer, with almost no loss of life, on Coruscant by allowing the Force to guide him at the Liberator's controls, mirroring a similar achievement by his father at the end of the Clone Wars. Skywalker continued to pilot an immense variety of starships throughout his life, from a Mandalorian Bes'uliik fighter to his wife's ship, the Jade Shadow.<br><br>Luke was proficient in unarmed combat. He was able to defeat Guri, who was an expert in unarmed combat. He often used physical attacks when he was in lightsaber combat to defeat enemies like Jabba's thugs to even kicking Darth Vader down a stair case in their final duel. In the duel at the lake of apparitions, Luke killed the entity Abeloth by pushing his elbow through Abeloth's head. He also overpowered Darth Krayt when the Dark Lord tried to Force drain him by bashing him and throwing him to the surface of the lake.<br><br>Luke was able to speak a variety of languages such as Galactic Basic, Huttese, Jawa Trade language, Shyriiwook, and Yuzz, and he claimed to know twelve other common languages.

<p>
The Superhero Database Classification number, or SHDB Class, is a number that represents the overall 'power' of a character. All traits of a character are used for calculating the Classification.
</p>
<h5>What it DOESN'T mean</h5>
<p>
This doesn't mean that a higher class would always beat a lower class character. But the bigger the difference in Class is, the more obvious it is who'll win in a fight.
</p>
<h5>How is this calculated</h5>
<pre class="footnote">( INT^1.3 + (STR*0.5 )^2 + (SPE*0.5)^2 + DUR^1.6 + (POW + (SPS*SPL))^2 + COM^1.8 ) ^ TIER</pre>
<h6>Super Power Score and Level</h6>
<p>Every Super Power has a score (SPS) that is used to calculate the Class. Each Super Power also has 3 levels (SPL). The level is set when connecting that Super Power to a character. The level determines the final score, of the Super Power, being used in the calculation.
