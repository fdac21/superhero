<h3>Kick-Ass's History</h3>
Dave Lizewski lead a typical high school life. He wasn't popular or a geek or class clown. He was just another average student at his high school. Nothing special about him really.. Just a kid who liked Ryan Reynolds movies, Snow Patrol and the Goo-Goo Dolls. He couldn't even strike up a conversation with the girl he liked. His mother died of an aneurysm when he was fourteen and he lived with his dad, who was still having problems coping with her death. As an escape, Dave played a lot of video games and was really into comic books. He became so obsessed with comics that he decided that was the career he wanted for himself, even though superheroes didn't really exist in the world.<br><br>One night he decided to put on a costume. He spent the first few weeks walking around on rooftops getting used to the costume and enjoying the thrill of wearing it underneath his clothes. He spent time working out in his high school gym during lunch and also ate high protein foods to try and pack on lean muscle all the while trying to come up with a name.<br><br>One day he decided to go into action. Seeing some kids spray painting a wall, he felt this was his time. Having courage from wearing a mask and costume, he approached and insulted the three kids. After an exchanging of words, a fight began with a costumed Dave throwing the first attack that came in the form of a improvised miniature bat. He used bottles as well as his own weapon to fight off the thugs but their numbers overwhelmed him. Things didn't go so well as Dave ended up getting stabbed by the first man that he attacked upon arriving on the scene. <br><br>The thugs rushed off and Dave struggled to walk home. Crossing the road, he ends up getting hit by a car and became a victim of a hit and run as the ones responsible fled the area. He was left with two broken legs and a crushed spine yet in his horrendous state he was able to take off his costume and hide it before the paramedics arrived.<br><br>After months of counseling and therapy, Dave burns all of his comic books and promised himself to never partake in heroics ever again. A promise he immediately broke.<br><br>Donning his costume once again, he roams the streets only to find a man getting mugged by three &quot;Puerto Ricans&quot;. This time Dave was armed with not one but two of the improvised mini bats which he kept strapped to his back. In a act of bravery or stupidity he decided to take on the three men. The fight instantly became bloody and again Dave became overwhelmed by the number of attackers. This time though, he was able to fight himself out of the beating reaching a point where the Puerto Ricans left saying that he was &quot;f***ing nuts&quot;. The crowd that had gathered to watch the battle cheered Dave on, while a young man takes out his cellphone and records the fight, putting it on youtube for all to see. Dave becomes a local celebrity and his costumed persona finally has a name, given to him by the masses, Kick-Ass. <br><br>In his regular life he gains the confidence and even gets the courage to talk to the hottest girl in school and she reciprocates. By now Dave is on cloud nine only to be brought down by his best friend Toddy Haynes when he tells him that every one thinks he is gay because he was found naked those months ago when he first donned the costume. Being the opportunist Dave played the role of the supposed &quot;gay best friend&quot; just so he could be close to the girl that he had a crush on. He also received a can of mace from his father he showed concern from all of Dave's new cuts and bruises. <br><br>As Kick-Ass he sets up a myspace page to come into contact with victims or people who need his assistance. On his first mission he went to a hotel building looking to deal with a man named Eddie Lomas. The call came from Eddie ex girlfriend saying that he was making crank calls to her and she asked Kick-Ass to go have a little &quot;talk&quot; with him. After a few condescending jokes about Dave costume made by Eddie and his crew, a fight break's out between Kick-ass and Lomas's posse. He used the can of mace that his father gave him on Eddie but was quickly stuck from behind. It looked evident that Kick-Ass was about to be severely beaten again we suddenly a mysterious young girl in costume carrying a katana sword appears. She uses the sword first on Eddie driving it through his back. Then she uses it on one of the crew members, cutting half of his head off. With 2 men now dead she makes an open challenge to the rest of the people in the room as she began to pull out a second katana sword.<br><br>Unlike Dave, the young girl was well trained and ruthless in her form of justice. He watched as she one by one killed the people in the room thinking &quot;she handled those knives like a f***ing surgeon&quot;. When it was over she assured him that they were on the same side and took off so that cops would not find her at the scene. Kick-Ass followed only to see her go to a large costumed man. Through their interaction Kick-Ass found out that the girl's name was Hit-Girl and the man was known as Big Daddy. As they fled Kick-Ass was impressed at how they carried themselves and the tactics they used and called them &quot;the real deal&quot;<br><br>The murder of the people in the Lomas house made Dave extremely uneasy. Thinking that it could all be pinned back to him he vowed to never again put on the costume again in fear of going to jail. His meeting with Hit-Girl and Big Daddy left him wondering and he began to search the internet were he had become popular but could find nothing on them. After a conversation with Eddie Lomas's ex girlfriend Dave feels more comfortable about his name staying clear but still is convinced that he will never become Kick-Ass again. <br><br>For a few weeks Dave had laid low not doing any type of vigilante hero work but that was all it took for him to be replaced. In that time span a new hero had emerged and in Dave's eyes had become an attention-whore. After checking out some forums Dave decided that for a few nights it was time to hit the streets again donning the costume one more time as Kick-Ass but found that the city was calmer then ever. Dave then found himself once again playing the gay best friend role with his long time crush Katie Deauxma. She could sense that something was not right and after thinking quickly his response to her in an attempt to cover his true feeling were that his was afraid to tell his father about the gay stuff. After some soothing words by Katie, Dave reiterated the fact that he was not a homosexual by concealing the fact that he had an erection as she laid her head on his chest to comfort him..After news reports that gave the new hero that called himself The Red Mist credit for Kick-Ass's accomplishments Dave had had enough. By using Myspace which was dubbed the twenty-first century version of the Bat signal, Kick-Ass arranged a meeting with The Red Mist to get some answers. To Kick-Ass's surprise when they met The Red Mist claimed to be his biggest fan. After a small talk Red Mist asked Kick-Ass to do a team up for the night and introduced him to the Mist Mobile. The two seemed to hit it off and became good friend while they patrolled the city. When the night seemed to be winding down they ran into something that neither of them expected, a burning down building. At first glance The Red Mist was reluctant to go in but after some persuasion by Kick-Ass they both ran into the building looking for a woman's baby that was named Charlie. The whole time Red Mist complained saying that Kick-Ass was nuts and when they finally found the &quot;baby&quot; it turned out to be a cat. The fire had then became too overwhelming and the building came down on them but they were rescued by the firefights that had shown up later. <br><br>When the two left the scene they were received as heroes making such an impact that they brought people to tears. When Dave returned home he jumped on the web and noticed that he had regained his &quot;rockstar&quot; status. Little did he know that Hit-Girl and Big Daddy were in his room. After getting his attention they showed that they were not impressed with what he had done. But wanted to see how he would do against the mob. <br><br>While Big-Daddy held him down the pair of vigilantes offered Kick-Ass a chance to team up with them. They were going after the mob's &quot;Boss of Bosses&quot; and needed the help of Kick-Ass and The Red Mist. At first Big-Daddy opposed but after speaking to his daughter Hit-Girl he agreed that a team-up needed to be done. After releasing his grip on him Big-Daddy orders Hit-Girl to tell Kick-Ass their origin. She begins to speak and reveals that Big-Daddy is her father and a former police officer that &quot;couldn't be paid off&quot;. Also she said that the mob killed his wife, her mother and that is why they were on a quest for revenge. At first Dave was reluctant claiming that he did not want to kill but was left with no choice when Big-Daddy blackmailed him say that if he and The Red Mist did not work with them he would leak his identity on the internet. <br><br>By this point Dave was changed. The things that mattered to him before seemed irrelevant. It was becoming harder for him to relate to non &quot;superheroes&quot;. He soon met up with The Red Mist to decide on what they would do. Red Mist seemed reluctant but after a conversation with Kick-Ass decided to meet at Big-Daddy's hideout. The two then parted was and Dave had a rush of adrenaline that he said came from second hand contact from The Red Mist's weed . He went to Katie Deauxma's house and shouted at her window &quot;I've been Kick-Ass all along and I'm not Gay&quot; but as soon as she opened the window he cowered and ran away. Later he meets up with Red Mist again this time heading to the hideout of Big-Daddy and Hit-Girl. They make their way inside to find Big-Daddy severely beaten up and Hit-Girl crying by his side. Big-Daddy notices Kick-Ass at the door and asks for his help but before he could act. The Red Mist pulls a gun and points it to the back of Dave's head showing his allegiance to the mob. </div>

<p>
The Superhero Database Classification number, or SHDB Class, is a number that represents the overall 'power' of a character. All traits of a character are used for calculating the Classification.
</p>
<h5>What it DOESN'T mean</h5>
<p>
This doesn't mean that a higher class would always beat a lower class character. But the bigger the difference in Class is, the more obvious it is who'll win in a fight.
</p>
<h5>How is this calculated</h5>
<pre class="footnote">( INT^1.3 + (STR*0.5 )^2 + (SPE*0.5)^2 + DUR^1.6 + (POW + (SPS*SPL))^2 + COM^1.8 ) ^ TIER</pre>
<h6>Super Power Score and Level</h6>
<p>Every Super Power has a score (SPS) that is used to calculate the Class. Each Super Power also has 3 levels (SPL). The level is set when connecting that Super Power to a character. The level determines the final score, of the Super Power, being used in the calculation.
