<h3>Anti-Monitor's History</h3>
Mobius was a powerful and ancient being who was universally known as the Anti-Monitor.<br><br><h4>Early Existence</h4>
Mobius was created by a Super Celestial named Perpetua in the Sixth Dimension alongside his brothers Mar Novu and Alpheus. Perpetua had been sent from the greater Omniverse to build a new Multiverse, and the three brothers were its first inhabitants. Perpetua explained to the three children that her Multiverse comprised three main realms made out of the three basic forms of matter: dark matter, rich with potential; positive matter, firm and constant; and anti-matter, all-destroying and corrosive. The three had been created to monitor these realms. Alpheus was tasked with monitoring the dark matter realm beneath creation where he would be a mighty World Forger, building the myriad worlds and universes of creation. Mar Novu was tasked with monitoring the positive matter realm, where he would guard the many universes that rose out of the dark from cosmic crises. The last brother, Mobius, was made Novu's opposite, tasked with making sure the light of creation did not breach the greater Omniverse.<br><br>After discovering that Perpetua's prolonged existence defied her natural function, Mar Novu gathered his brothers to oppose their mother. They met up in the Promethean Galaxy, where they attempted to contact the Judges of the Source in order to alert them of Perpetua's crimes. Perpetua's forces attacked the brothers, but an envoy of the Source, in the form of a Raptor, imprisoned Pepetua inside a wall made of her own legions. Due to the wall making his domain obsolete, Mobius vowed to kill his brother Mar Novu, even if it took a billion years. The three brothers then reformed on their respective dimensions.<br><br><h4>Reborn</h4>
As the multiverse was being remade, Krona went back into time during this exact moment. His actions resulted in the Multiverse splintering off intro an infinite number of universes. Mobius later took on a new form in this universe and Perpetua started poisoning his mind by whispering to him, even while trapped in the Source Wall, so she could free herself. As she planned, the Anti-Monitor went on a rampage to destroy the Multiverse before eventually being stopped, in a crisis that was called Crisis on Infinite Earths. His actions however had caused the various universes to merge into a single universe, while the crisis had caused a crack in the Source wall to develop, which allowed Perpetua to assert more influence on the minds of others.<br><br>After the Flashpoint, he was reborn again on the planet Qward, Mobius was a seeker of knowledge and scientific genius who built a device known as the Mobius Chair in order to learn the secret that gave birth to the creation of his universe. Mobius was also ruthless in pursuit of his goals and was a killer who murdered many people. Mobius' thirst for the knowledge of his universe's creation would be his downfall, as such knowledge was forbidden, thus when he laid his eyes upon it—the Anti-Life Equation—he was forever cursed by it, and transformed into the "Anti-Monitor", the living embodiment of the Anti-Life Equation. He lashed out in pain and became a destroyer of universes.<br><br>Some time after that, he met a New God, known as Metron, to whom he willingly gave his universe-traveling Mobius Chair. Millennia later, the Anti-Monitor visited a parallel universe's Krypton, where the malignant Jor-Il set into motion events that drew his ire for their entire race. He destroyed the planet, leaving nothing alive. However, Jor-Il was able to send his only son, Kal-Il, away from Krypton towards the planet Earth before his demise. In sending his son away, Jor-Il hoped to lay the seeds for revenge against the Anti-Monitor.<br><br>In the future, the Anti-Monitor defeats Kal-Il and his allies in the Crime Syndicate, destroying everything on Earth as he did on Krypton. The Syndicate abandons Earth and tries to travel between universes to find one they can subjugate, but become stuck between universes. Only Alfred Pennyworth, going by the alias of the Outsider, and Atomica, manage to escape their prison when the Justice League forces Darkseid through a Boom-Tube.<br><br>Some time after Anti-Monitor destroyed Earth 3, he encountered Grail, the powerful daughter of the malevolent Dark God Darkseid, who informed him that he could free himself from the Anti-Life Equation by killing Darkseid, during which time reality would fracture and the line between gods and men would blur, which would allow him to separate himself from the Equation. They became allies, and she helped him prepare for his coming war against Darkseid.<br><br>When the rest of the Syndicate invaded the parallel Earth, the true nature of the entity who destroyed their world is revealed. They initially claimed that they destroyed their homeworld when its citizens rose up against the them, forcing the Syndicate to destroy the planet. This was revealed to be a lie, and it's shown that their world was destroyed by an alien entity that none of them could stop: none other than the Anti-Monitor. They had arrived to Prime Earth in an effort to hide from him.<br><br>To the dismay of the Syndicate, following the death of Power Ring by Sinestro, his Power Ring sent reverberations throughout the Multiverse, something Kal-Il worried may alert the Anti-Monitor to the Syndicate's location. But before he could do anything about it, the Injustice League came into conflict with the Syndicate, resulting in the deaths of Deathstorm, Atomica and Johnny Quick, as well as the incarcerations of Ultraman and Superwoman. (Owlman, however, eluded the Injustice League and was believed to be in hiding.)<br><br>When the Justice League, having reconvenes after being freed from Firestorm, discussed how best to approach whatever entity destroyed the Crime Syndicate's world, whom they supposedly believed to be Darkseid—a fact which they do not yet know to be very wrong—Cyborg suggests they find the Ring of Volthoom: he reasons that if the ring is similar in nature to that of a Green Lantern Ring, it would have a combat log detailing Harold Jordan and the Syndicate's clashes with the Anti-Monitor. The trouble, though, would be finding the ring's location.<br><br>The League does eventually find the ring, but not before the Doom Patrol does. The ring has found a new host in Jessica Cruz, and creates a green fire large enough to be seen across the Multiverse, fulfilling the Syndicate's fears. Niles Caulder, intent on stopping the Power Ring by killer her, is in turn murdered by Lex Luthor, who's plan of merely subduing her succeeds. Batman appears and, relieving Jessica her fears, they effectively shut down the ring. The Ring attempts to warn Batman of the Anti-Monitor, but it is shut down before it can explain the true nature of the destructive entity.<br><br><h4>Darkseid War</h4>
Mobius' old acquaintance, Metron, came across with him while he was preparing his invasion of Earth. He tried to convince Mobius that his actions will lead to the demise of all reality, that he must abandon his plans of destruction, but Mobius rebuffed his claims, claiming that he needed to do it in order to start a war with Darkseid and end the era of the New Gods.<br><br>After his ally opened the doorway between the universes, the Anti-Monitor finally arrived at the Earth where he would ultimately confront Darkseid. After summoning an army of shadows and, cloaked the sun, he effortlessly defeats the Amazon trying to stop him, is was about to destroy his enemies when Metron arrives to teleport them away, but he nonetheless decided to focus on the upcoming war, requesting Grail to bring her father to him.<br><br>After a long wait, Darkseid and his forces of Apokolips finally arrive, and the war of the Dark God against the Anti-God has finally begun. The battle rages-on until a desperate Darkseid summons the embodiment of Death to aid him, unto which Mobius uses his power to merge it with the nearby being of speed to transform it into his own weapon. Together with the power of the Anti-Life Equation, Mobius delivers a fatal blow to Darkseid, ultimately killing the Dark God.<br><br>After killing Darkseid, the Anti-Monitor places himself into a cocoon of energy and separates from the Anti-Life Equation, returning to his original form as "Mobius", the way he was before he was turned into the "Anti-Monitor" by the Anti-Life Equation.<br><br>Mobius emerging from his cocoon in his original form, still possessing vast power and an army of shadow demons, and in order to get his Mobius Chair back from Batman, engages both the Justice League and Crime Syndicate in battle in Gotham City. Mobius kills several Green Lanterns during the battle, vaporizing them with powerful blasts of antimatter. Ultraman assaults Mobius with a vengeance, but Mobius gets the upper hand and kills Ultraman, vaporizing him with a concentrated blast of antimatter on his chest. Lex Luthor, who had been transformed into the God of Apokolips and had gained Darkseid's powers, steps into the fight with an army of parademons at his side, ready to engage Mobius.<br><br>Mobius and Lex Luthor engage each other in battle, Lex seemingly having the upper hand.[17] However, Mobius counters with a burst of super speed and grapples him, holding fast his throat and slowly killing him with his anti-matter energy. Suddenly, his former ally Grail arrives via Boom Tube with a super-powered Steve Trevor: Grail had transformed him with the Anti-Life Equation. Trevor proceeds to fire an immensely powerful blast of Anti-Life energy at Mobius, killing him instantly.<br><br><h4>Justice/Doom War</h4>
Mobius was resurrected once again, this time in his original form, where and when he witnessed events occurring in the Multiverse that included his mother Perpetua being freed from her imprisonment. At some point, Mobius returned in the Antimatter Universe where he killed many Qwardians and wrote a message destined to his brothers saying "do not follow me". Later, he saved Aquaman during the Drowned Earth's event and recruited the Aquaman to aid him in stopping Perpetua and knew that a piece of the Totality resided in the past. Thus, he dispatched Arthur Curry there to aid his Justice League allies.<br><br>At this point, Mobius was sought out by his brothers and the Justice League in stopping his mother who similarly sought to recruit him. During the fight, Mobius merged with his kin in forming the Ultra-Monitor after being empowered by Starman's Totality and fought against Perpetua. At first, they managed to match their mother's power, but her allies managed to achieve their objective, thus restoring the Totality of her might. With it, she moved the Multiverse towards doom and infected Mobius with Anti-Life, allowing him to bring his brothers down and thus, his full form restored, he joined Perpetua's side as he'd really wanted all this time.<br><br>After the rise of her mother, Mobius saw the destruction of Earth-19 by Perpetua's hand. Later, she plans to assign Mobius to the World Forge where he will create universes meant to be destroyed by the Apex Predator army led by Lex Luthor, as a neverending cycle of war where doom will triumph over justice eternally. Later, Mobius was sent to kill Hawkgirl by Perpetua. </div>

<p>
The Superhero Database Classification number, or SHDB Class, is a number that represents the overall 'power' of a character. All traits of a character are used for calculating the Classification.
</p>
<h5>What it DOESN'T mean</h5>
<p>
This doesn't mean that a higher class would always beat a lower class character. But the bigger the difference in Class is, the more obvious it is who'll win in a fight.
</p>
<h5>How is this calculated</h5>
<pre class="footnote">( INT^1.3 + (STR*0.5 )^2 + (SPE*0.5)^2 + DUR^1.6 + (POW + (SPS*SPL))^2 + COM^1.8 ) ^ TIER</pre>
<h6>Super Power Score and Level</h6>
<p>Every Super Power has a score (SPS) that is used to calculate the Class. Each Super Power also has 3 levels (SPL). The level is set when connecting that Super Power to a character. The level determines the final score, of the Super Power, being used in the calculation.
