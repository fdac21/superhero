<h3>Noelle Silva's History</h3>
Noelle is a noble who was born as the second daughter of House Silva, the royal family of the Clover Kingdom. She has a rough childhood, as she is ridiculed and called a defect by her own family because of her lack of control over her magical powers,[1] and is blamed for the death of her mother, who was a powerful mage and subsquently died giving birth to Noelle.[2] Noelle spends her childhood days with her cousin, Mimosa Vermillion, where they would explore and play within an abandoned ruin of buildings. After finding out about her difficulty to control her own magical power, Noelle also spends a fair amount of time in the ruin to train on her own.[3]<br><br>When Noelle turns 15 years old, she is inducted into the Black Bull squad over the captain's good grace after her own older brother, Nozel Silva, rejected her entry to his ranks in the Silver Eagle squad.[4][1]<br><br>Sometime after the Magic Knights Entrance Exam, she observes from the Black Bull's headquarters when her fellow squadmates are giving an initiation ceremony to another new member, Asta.[5] She later meets with him while Magna Swing is taking him on a tour of the headquarters. Noelle rejects Asta's kind offer of friendship and decides to explain their differences in status with her magic. However, her attack misses and hits Magna instead. After failing to convince Magna that it is his own fault, Noelle storms out while discarding her squad robe.[6]<br><br>Noelle trapped in her own magic.<br><br>Later at dawn, Noelle trains by herself to fix her lack of control while remembering the painful memories, she received from her family. Once she declares that she will prove her worth, her power turns berserk and a giant sphere of water appears as it traps Noelle at the center. Fortunately, Asta managed to save her by cutting the sphere with his sword after the Black Bull captain throws him at it. As Noelle and Asta fall, Finral Roulacase manages to let them land safely on the ground with his magic. Noelle is then encouraged by her squadmates, even though she expected them to mock her.[7]<br><br>Later on, Noelle and Asta receive their first mission as a Magic Knight. She declines the mission at first, but quickly changes her mind after being threatened by Yami. Noelle, along with Asta and Magna, travel to the village of Sosshi via Magna's broom, because she is unable to ride a broom on her own and Finral cannot open a gate to a place which is neither in his line-of-sight nor which he had not visit beforehand. Once they arrive, however, a fight occurs between them and a group of mages led by Heath Grice.[8]<br><br>Noelle casts a spell to protect the villagers.<br><br>During the fight, Noelle tries to attack Heath but fails because of her lack of control over her magical power. Heath's comment on her disability begins to discourage her, which is strengthen by Magna's request for her to retreat. However, when one of the young girls of the village begs for her protection, Noelle regains her confidence, which causes her grimoire to reveal a new spell, Sea Dragon's Nest. She then quickly casts the protection spell, which manages to protect all of them from Heath and his group's combined assaults.[9] Noelle maintains her spell, while Magna and Asta delivers their counterattack and casts a smaller scale of the said spell on Magna at the end of their assault. Her sudden progression makes her very happy, but she decides to keep it for herself.[10]<br><br>As the fight ends, Noelle acknowledges Asta's qualities as she sees the latter faints, because of exhaustion.[11] She later becomes enamored with the anti-bird that follows Asta all this time.[12] Afterwards, Noelle witnesses Heath commit suicide while bringing two of his subordinates along with him. She later follows Asta around while focusing her attention on the anti-bird and proposed to take care of said bird before they encounter Nick, the grandson of the man who requested the mission. She watches as Asta gives Nick a few words of encouragement.[13]<br><br>Noelle receives her first salary.<br><br>Having returned to the headquarters, Noelle, along with Magna and Asta, reports back to Yami and receives her first salary. She then goes on a shopping trip to Kikka with Asta and Vanessa Enoteca, during which Vanessa takes her to the black market to find items that could help her control her magical power.[14]<br><br>A man, named Sekke Bronzazza, tries to flirt with her and Vanessa while they look at an item, but she coldly rejects him. Her opinions of Sekke do not change, even when she learns that he is Asta's acquaintance. It decreases even further when he tries to impress her by trying to catch a thief whom snatched an old lady's bag. Noelle leaves with her squadmates after Asta and Sekke managed to apprehend the thief and returned the old lady's belongings.[15]<br><br>Noelle and Asta deciding the anti-bird's name.<br><br>Days later, Noelle is assigned on a mission to explore a newly emerged dungeon along with Asta and Luck Voltia. As they enter the dungeon, Noelle has a heated argument with Asta, in regards to the anti-bird's name. However, it is soon put to rest after Luck suggested Nero for the name.[16]<br><br>A moment later, they begin to walk through the dungeon in complete darkness after Noelle bumped Asta from the back, which led him to drop their only source of light. Fortunately, Luck confirms that they have reached the inner-side of the dungeon where Noelle can feel the dense amount of mana in the atmosphere. Noelle and Asta are quickly in a pinch when Luck begins to activates almost all of the trap magic set within the dungeon after Asta accidentally activated one of them. Additionally, Noelle and Asta are left befuddled after Luck decided to leave them for an unknown agenda.[17]<br><br>Noelle caught in a trap.<br><br>Suddenly, another trap was activated and managed to strangle Noelle before Asta comes to her rescue. As the trap begins to restrain Asta, Noelle witnesses a powerful magic spell easily destroys it, which left her amazed towards the user whom is able to cast such a powerful spell.[18]<br><br>Noelle then learns the identity of the spell caster is Yuno, an acquaintance of Asta and a member of the Golden Dawn squad. She is then caught in a series of arguments between Asta and Klaus Lunettes after her cousin, Mimosa Vermillion, strikes up a conversation with her. Noelle is also left speechless when Klaus asks about the whereabouts of Luck Voltia.[19]<br><br>Noelle explores the dungeon.<br><br>Subsequently, after the Golden Dawn members leave to conquer the dungeon, Noelle questions the method, which Asta proposes to find the center of dungeon until Nero points them to a tunnel.[20] They decide to follow Nero's guidance, but find themselves in an area with unstable gravitational force. While she tries to control her body, Noelle is also unable to prevent Asta from capturing a walking treasure chest and left nauseated after seeing the living organs inside it.[21]<br><br>They continue their search for the center of the dungeon when Asta suddenly stops after he heard a peculiar noise. Noelle assumes that the noise comes from Luck's fight. When Asta suggests on giving Luck some help, Noelle argues by saying that Luck left to fight in the first place and their main priority is to reach the center of the dungeon.[22]<br><br>In the end, Noelle and Asta decide to help Luck and forsake their mission as they arrived at Luck's side. The moment Luck agrees to defeat the opponent together, the latter immediately traps them within a shroud of thick smokes.[23] Noelle tries to break the smoke veil by attacking it with her magic, but to no avail. She begins to worry about the possibility of being suffocated, if they do not quickly defeat their opponent.[24]<br><br>Noelle pushes Asta towards Lotus.<br><br>Noelle then participates on Luck's plan to defeat their opponent with her in charge of launching Asta towards Lotus Whomalt while Luck guides him towards their direction. She remarks that she has to suppress her magic as much as possible to avoid on being detected. As soon as their opponent is in position, Noelle sends Asta flying with her spell and they manage to land a significant damage on their opponent.[25]<br><br>Regretfully, their opponents manage to escape at the last moment as Asta ceases his pursuit. Noelle and her squadmates then decide to return to their original objective of heading over to the center of the dungeon.[26]<br><br>Noelle protects Mimosa.<br><br>Upon their arrival, Noelle witnesses as Asta and Yuno are about to fight another opponent together.[27] She also encounters Mimosa whom lies within her spell as she tries to recuperate. Seeing her unguarded cousin, Noelle immediately casts a defensive spell around her and promises to keep her safe.[28]<br><br>Noelle then begins fighting puppets made by Mars, the Diamond Kingdom's mage, when she starts hearing Klaus' comments on Asta's strength. She tries to explain her squadmate's power, but decides to let Klaus judges Asta's worth by his own eyes.[29] After Mars is defeated and restrained, the six Magic Knights of the Clover Kingdom enter the center of the dungeon with Asta forcefully cuts down the door for them. Upon seeing the treasures being stored behind the door, it quickly amazes them as they spread out and explores the treasury.[30]<br><br>Noelle is critically injured.<br><br>Unbeknownst to them, Mars manages to regain his consciousness and storms into the treasury.[31] When Noelle notices that Mars has activated a fire-based healing magic spell, she immediately tries to extinguish it with her magic. Unfortunately, Mars reaction is faster than her and manages to land a critical damage on her.[32] Mars' attack renders Noelle unconscious, but she is able to wake up after Mimosa activates her strongest healing spell to keep Noelle alive. As she awakens, Noelle immediately orders Asta to finish the fight quickly while also revealing that he is the only commoner that she has ever acknowledged.[33][34]<br><br>Unfortunately, Asta fails to fulfill his promise as he falls to the ground with a blade pierces his stomach.[35] After Yuno defeats Mars through an unknown means, Noelle quickly asks Mimosa to heal Asta, but the dungeon suddenly starts collapsing.[36][37] She and the rest escape the dungeon on top of Yuno's Heavenly Wind Ark.[38] After they manage to reach the exit, Noelle remains close to Asta as he regains his consciousness. She is then taken by surprise when Klaus acknowledges her squadmate by hugging him in front of the others.[39]<br><br>Noelle meets the Magic Emperor.<br><br>A week after the mission completion, Noelle is tasked to go to the Magic Knights headquarters to give a report, in regards the mission. While accompanied by Asta, the couple encounter Klaus, Yuno and Mimosa on their way to the designated venue. She then notices that her cousin's suspicious act towards Asta, which prompts Noelle to ask her about it. When Noelle finds out that Mimosa has feelings for Asta, the former begins to fluster as she tries to comprehend her own feelings about the situation.[40]<br><br>Moments later, the five of them arrive at the designated venue where they are welcomed by the Magic Emperor, Julius Novachrono.[41] After a dialogue with the Emperor, Noelle and the others are invited by the former to attend a War Merits Conferment Ceremony that honors the achievements of several Magic Knights.[42]<br><br>Noelle forced to leave by her siblings.<br><br>As soon as the ceremony ends, Noelle attends the celebratory banquet in which she and her squadmates on the dungeon exploring mission are scrutinized by the honorary Magic Knights. Ultimately, her own siblings, who are also among the receivers of the medals, start humiliating her and force her to leave the venue. Suddenly, Asta takes her arm and prevents Noelle from leaving before expressing his feelings regarding the matters at hand.[43][44]<br><br>After someone notifies the Knights that the Royal Capital is under attack, Noelle joins her colleagues in defending the city. She follows the captain of the Crimson Lion squad, Fuegoleon Vermillion, as he tries to catch up to his younger brother.[45] Noelle arrives at the North District of the Royal Capital alongside the two brothers from House Vermillion. She then begins to show her hesitation when the other Knights start decimating the army of corpses that invade the city.[46]<br><br>Noelle being reprimanded by Fuegoleon.<br><br>Her hesitation continues when she notices that Asta is struggling against his opponent. She becomes reluctant to save Asta after remembering her meeting with her older siblings prior to the invasion. Due to this, Noelle fails to react when several corpses are charging towards her. Luckily, Fuegoleon manages to save her just in time before reprimanding her for her lack of focus in the battlefield.[47] After a few words of encouragement from the Crimson Lion captain, Noelle quickly assists Asta by protecting the little girl that the latter has been struggling to protect.[48]<br><br>Subsequently, Noelle is unable to assist Asta in fighting No.2 - Alfred, because she and Leopold are engaged in a different fight against No.3 - David.[49] After hearing Fuegoleon's words of encouragement, Noelle immediately prepares herself for her fight.[50] The two nobles are finally able to defeat their opponent and Noelle unintentionally gives a salute after Fuegoleon praises their efforts.[51]<br><br>Noelle sees Fuegoleon's body returns.<br><br>Not long after, the Crimson Lion's captain is suddenly teleported away from their location.[52] Noelle quickly tries to locate the perpetrator before Asta steps in and finds Valtos under a pile of corpses. The man then opens another portal, which sends back the lifeless body of Fuegoleon. Noelle is rendered surprised and speechless with the turn of events.[53]<br><br>She rushes to Fuegoleon's body and tries to stop his bleeding after she discovers that the captain's grimoire is still intact. However, it begins to crumble as she uses her own clothes to stop the bleeding. She is then occupied on protecting Fuegoleon's body while Asta and Leopold are engaged in a fight against Valtos and Rades.[54][55] She can only watch as the enemy's reinforcements come and Asta stands his ground to fight them.[56]<br><br>Noelle protects Fuegoleon's body.<br><br>Noelle tries to assist Asta and Leopold while they are fighting against the five mages, but her protective spell is easily neutralized by one of the mages. As she is occupied on protecting Fuegoleon's body, Noelle can only watch as the mages try to kill Asta and Leopold. Fortunately, the rest of the Magic Knights are able to return and intercept the attack.[57] However, once again, Noelle is unable to prevent the opponents, who identified themselves as members of the Eye of the Midnight Sun, from taking Asta away as they escape.[58]<br><br>Noelle immediately proposes a rescue mission to her fellow Knights, but none of them complies and Nozel clearly states their priority is to establish the city's defenses before another attack. As she realizes that further effort to convince them is useless, Noelle quickly turns her attention to Fuegoleon and asks Mimosa to treat him. She remains close to Fuegoleon's body while a part of her thoughts is worried about Asta.[59]<br><br>Noelle listens to Julius after the conflict is ceased.<br><br>As Fuegoleon and Leopold receive their treatment, Noelle waits outside of the medical ward alongside her colleagues when Julius returns with Asta. She then slightly criticizes Asta for being kidnapped while her thoughts express relief over his safety. Suddenly, Klaus pushes her aside as he expresses his relief towards Asta. Noelle is then rendered speechless when Mimosa hugs Asta out of sheer relief.[60] She remains with her colleagues when Julius assesses the threat and gives the Knights a few words of encouragement for their future conflicts.[61]<br><br>Later on, Noelle strolls around the Royal Capital with Asta and Charmy Pappitson as they prepare to depart from the city. While enjoying a piece of pastry, Noelle asks Charmy about her method of entry to the city. The noblewoman is left speechless when she witnesses Charmy's versatile magic. After they encountered the Golden Dawn members and said their farewell, Noelle returns to the Black Bull's headquarters. While she listens to her squadmates' conversation, Noelle is stunned when Finral invites Asta to a blind date.[62]<br><br>Noelle works as a waitress to observe a blind date.<br><br>Due to this, the noblewoman then decides to observe the blind date from afar. She follows the boys to Nairn and applies to work as a waitress at the restaurant where the date is being held. As Noelle observes Asta, she recognizes Sekke who is on a blind date as well. She quickly blasts him with her Water Magic when he asks for a drink.[63] While her attention is shifted for a moment, Asta manages to have a lively conversation with Rebecca Scarlet, which quickly irritates Noelle. The restaurant's manager tries to warn the noblewoman of her misbehavior, but Noelle coldly shuts him up.[64]<br><br>When Asta and his date are forced to flee from the restaurant, Noelle quickly follows them after she tenders her resignation to the manager. She then finds them in an alley and decides to eavesdrop on them. The moment Asta confirms to his date that he has someone he likes, Noelle quickly jumps to the conclusion that she is the referred person, which throws her into a state of panic.[65] Due to this, Noelle decides to follow Asta and learns that another girl, Marie Adlai, plans to take him as her husband.[66] Subsequently, the noblewoman becomes furious when Asta accepts an offer to sleep at Rebecca's house.[67]<br><br>Noelle remains in Nairn.<br><br>Later that night, Noelle returns to Nairn where she sees a group of children walking towards the mountain area. She quickly goes to Asta as she questions the sudden change of weather and informs them of the children's behavior.[68] Not long after, Gauche Adlai, a senior from the Black Bull squad, finds a way to trace them. When Asta, Gauche, and Sister Theresa prepare to pursue the children, Noelle tries to come with them, but Gauche denies her request due to her inability to fly with a broom. As they leave, Noelle shockingly realizes that she is left alone with Rebecca.[69] After they leave, she contacts headquarters and tells them about the situation.[70]<br><br>While the Magic Knights captains are fighting the Third Eye, Rebecca makes some food for her siblings and Noelle, who delights in the taste but becomes worried that Asta would want someone who can cook. Rebecca expresses concern about Asta's well-being, and Noelle assures her that he is fine and that he will return like nothing happened and with the children. She then requests more food.[71] After Asta's return and visit to the Royal Capital, he and Noelle visit Rebecca, and Marco Scarlet returns Asta's robe. To thank Asta for saving her siblings, Rebecca kisses Asta on the cheek, shocking Noelle.[72]<br><br>Noelle visits Raque.<br><br>The Black Bulls travel to Raque for their secret mission to the Seabed Temple. However, the squad gets distracted and plays on the beach.[73] Noelle worries if her new bikini will attract Asta because she is jealous that Rebecca kissed him, and when she calls out to him for his opinion on her suit, he ignores her in favor of training his legs in the sand. Angry, Noelle fires a water bullet at him but hits Magna instead. He asks if she still cannot control her magic, and she brags that without her wand, she can only use defensive magic.[74] When Sekke's two friends hit on Noelle, she turns them down.[75] Yami appears and buries the squad up to their necks in sand. He then briefs them about the mission to infiltrate the water temple and the plan to access it during the full moon, when the mana currents are weakest. The squad is surprised that the captain did actual work, for which he threatens them. To get them to the ocean floor, he plans to use Noelle's Water Magic. She disapproves because she cannot control Sea Dragon's Nest, and worries that not only she but also the rest of the squad will drown should she fail. Yami agrees but since the mission is a secret and was given only to them, there is no one else. He gives her a week, when the next full moon appears, to train.[76]<br><br>Later that night, after performing the spell several times, Noelle still struggles to maintain and control Sea Dragon's Nest. She reflects on the tricks that Vanessa taught her but they did not work. However, she is not discouraged and resolves to keep trying. She then hears Asta yell because a crab pinched his toe while he was also training. He suggests that they train together as he can stop her if she loses control again. She initially rejects the idea but begins to acquiesce. Asta gets distracted by the sound of someone singing, and the two go off to investigate. Following the sound, they happen upon a girl standing on a rock.[77] Noelle remarks on the beauty of the singing and wonders from where the girl is and whether she is a ghost. Kahono notices the two and gets embarrassed, breaking the otherworldly feeling. Noelle wonders if the bubbles were Kahono's magic. When Kahono heals Asta, Noelle is impressed by her control. After Noelle accepts Kahono's friendship, Kahono instructs her on how to control her magic better and asks if she has any good memories with her family on which to focus. Noelle can only recall sad ones but stays silent about it, only mentioning a desire to continue training.[78]<br><br>Noelle completes Sea Dragon's Cradle.<br><br>They begin a cycle of training: Noelle forms Sea Dragon's Nest while Kahono and Asta cheer for her, and periodically Kahono heals Noelle. On the last night, Asta finally convinces Noelle to release control of her magic power and let her mana run wild, as he would save her again if her spell goes awry. While using the spell, she becomes disheartened as she has no happy memories. Just then the other Black Bulls show up and cheer for her, reminding her of the good times with them. Encouraged and focused, she completes Sea Dragon's Cradle but, in her moment of triumph, loses her concentration, showering her squadmates. As she falls, Asta catches her. While celebrating her success with her squad, she turns to thank Kahono, who has disappeared.[79]<br><br>Noelle then brings everyone to the Seabed Temple using her spell. Once they reach the temple, they are guided to meeting the head priest Gifso. After meeting with Gifso and learning that they will have to play a game to obtain the magic stone, the Black Bulls, except Yami, and the priests are transported to another location.[80] Noelle then listens as Gifso explains the rules of the game are and what it will take to win this game. Later Noelle encounters a priest and tries to bluff her way out of fighting, which the priest reveals herself as Kahono. Noelle and Kahono about the reason that they had met and how Kahono insists that they are friend, but Noelle denies this.

The group then departs, chasing after the dungeon.[128]<br><br>As they pass over Hage, they notice it is under attack, so Asta and Yuno request to go down and protect it. Nozel allows them to go by themselves and stops Noelle from joining them.[129] The Royal Knights reach Clover Castle just ahead of the dungeon.[130] The group of Magic Knights split up and head to different parts of the castle, with Nozel, Noelle, and Zora heading to defend House Silva's section. Once inside, Zora decides to go off on his own. Noelle protests but Nozel allows him. An elf then attacks the pair, and Nozel easily defends and knocks out the possessed Knight, amazing Noelle with his skill.[131]<br><br>Nozel crashes through the window and shields his younger brother from large compass needles, while Noelle follows up with a Sea Dragon's Roar directed at Kivn. The spell is deflected out of the tower, so Nebra takes the chance to hide their escape. Refusing to allow them to run away, the elf uses Another Atlas to disrupt the mana in the room, and Noelle struggles to maintain her Mana Skin. When Nozel orders his siblings to stay back because they cannot fight, Noelle refuses and Nozel then asks her to help show the elf the power of House Silva.[132]<br><br>Noelle uses Water Creation Magic: Valkyrie Dress.<br><br>Due to the swirling mana, Noelle is incapable of raising a Sea Dragon's Nest, so she floods the room with water while Nozel surrounds the siblings in a shell of mercury. Kivn is forced to release her spell, and Nozel takes that opportunity to restrain the elf.[133] Nozel admits his fear of losing their mother (or her appearance) again motivated his decision to discourage Noelle, and apologizes to Noelle, which shocks her and her siblings. The moment is cut short when Kivn stabs Nozel and erects a larger Another Atlas.

The elf then puts up a larger barrier so that Noelle will not be able to drown again. The elf also says that there is nothing they can do, and for them to give up and repent for their sins. Noelle wonders what to do, and decides to use her magic at close-range instead of long-range. Noelle then uses her magic to create herself an armor and weapons.[135] The elf quickly fires more needles at Noelle but Noelle easily dodges them and rushes forward. As Noelle gets closer, the elf uses her magic to distance herself from Noelle and fire more needles at Noelle. Noelle dodges the needles and closes the distance to the elf. As Noelle attack the elf, the elf uses her magic to block the attack. As the elf prepares to launch more needles, Noelle pushes forward and pierces through the elf's shield.[136] As Noelle defeats the elf, the Silva siblings are freed from the magic barrier of the elf.

As the servant starts to panic about being brought to this location, Zora reveals that his masters are wounded and about to die. The servant quickly uses his magic to heal Nebra, and asks Solid to bring Nozel over to him. As Solid does nothing, Zora starts to mocking Solid about how pathetic he is. Nozel over hears this and remembers talking to his mother about protecting his siblings. As Noelle tries to get Zora to stop mocking Solid, but Nozel says that Zora is right. Nozel then gets up after using his magic to fortify his body.<br><br>As Nozel and Noelle get ready to continue fighting, Zora uses a spell of them that allows them to see were all the traps he has placed are at.

The spells are reflected back at the elves when they his traps, and hit the elves.<br><br>Afterwards, the three mages notice the arrival of the Shadow Palace, and all of the elves that are descending from there. While Noelle wonders what to do, suddenly the Black Bulls appear from a portal and attack the elves while asking if everyone is okay. Noelle asks what took them so long, and that they better be grateful since she was able to keep them all fighting by learning a new magic spell. Noelle then thinks about how lonely and scared she was before they had arrived. Asta asks about the cool outfit that she is wearing, while Magna tells her that she better be thankful since they will be doing the protecting from now on. Zora wonders what the Black Bulls arrived in, which Noelle tells him that she has no idea either but is not surprised since she is used to everything being absurd by now. Zora and Noelle are then informed that the large walking bull is their ally. Yami orders the Black Bulls to handle the elves, but Zora and Noelle are soon paralyzed by Drowa and Eclat's Reflect Iris. They are freed when Asta strikes the pair of elves with his Demon-Destroyer Sword.<br><br>Zora and Noelle fly over on a broom and fall onto the pile of Black Bulls. The Black Bulls relocate to the courtyard of the castle and recover their magic power with Charmy's food, preparing to head into the Shadow Palace. They are attacked by more possessed Magic Knights, but Mereoleona and Fuegoleon Vermillion arrive and defeat the elves. As more possessed Golden Dawns arrive, Mereoleona thinks about how they have no time to face all the elves before the hole shrinks, the Black Bulls tells the captains that they will handle the elves while they head to the Shadow Palace. Magna tells Asta to head with the captains since they can use the power of his sword, which Asta says that he will go and wishes them the best of luck. Magna also says that they will be fine and to come back safely, while Noelle tries to tells them that she will go too. Kirsch then tells Mimosa to go with them to since they can use a healer, which Mimosa agrees since she can protect Asta too. Noelle once against tries to says that she will go too, but Solid tells her to head out with them since he acknowledges her as being the stronger one. Solid also says that one day he will surpass her and that she should also come back as the mightiest of the house of Silva, which Noelle agrees too.<br><br>Fuegoleon says that they are going to head out, which the elves responds that they are not going anywhere. The Black Bulls rush towards to elves, while saying that they are not going to get in their way and start to battle the elves. Fuegoleon, Mereoleona, Mimosa, Nozel, Noelle, and Asta then all head towards the Shadow Palace. As the Magic Knights pass through the gate to the Shadow Palace, they enter a strange space that disrupts their mana.

As Noelle fights Fana, Noelle notices that her Valkyrie Dress allows her to outmaneuver the elf. She also the elf as the one who possessed Fana from the Diamond Kingdom. Deciding not to hold back, Noelle fires her Sea Dragon's Roar spell and manages to destroy Fana's upper body, much to her shock. As Noelle begins to apologize for this, Fana's Phoenix Feathers Robe completely regenerates her body and the elf explains that the forbidden magic has allowed them to use even more unbelievable magic. Noelle wonders how she will deal with Fana, while Fana says that she is getting sick of dying.[139] As Noelle continues to battle Fana, none of her magic attacks works on Fana. Fana decides to end Noelle, but she is suddenly attacked by Jack the Ripper. Jack expresses his joy of finding a woman worthy of ripping apart, much to Fana's surprise. Noelle wonders why it had to be Jack who showed up, which Jack asks if she has a problem with him. Noelle and Jack continue to fight against Fana. Later Licht collects Fana's mana for a spell to use against Zagred, as her fight with Jack and Noelle continues. Fana thinks about how she cannot fight against Jack anymore due to his magic adapting to hers, when the creatures created from Zagred's magic comes into the room. Nozel and Mimosa show up and save Fana, while telling them all that they have to leave immediately.<br><br>After Zagred's defeat, the Shadow Palace begins to collapse with everyone on each floor rushing to escape the devil's magic, with the protective magic of Lemiel Silvamillion Clover and Licht beginning to wear off.

Asta notices that Charmy has returned to normal and comments about it, which Charmy replies that she has always been like this. Asta and Mimosa become confused by this and wonder if they were seeing things, while Noelle simply wonders why Charmy is here, which Charmy tells her that she will be anywhere where there is good food or where Yuno is. As the knights arrive back at the Kingdom, Nozel points out that everything is not over and that there are still elves rampaging throughout the Kingdom. After a plan is made by Patolli to bring William Vangeance back so he can help fix things, Noelle watches with everyone else as William, Asta, and Licht combine their magic to exorcise the rest of the elves, undoing the Reincarnation Magic and finally saving the Kingdom.<br><br>Later the Magic Knights begin to help the citizens of the kingdom, while commenting how the long battle is over. Mimosa is healing Asta on top of a tower, while Noelle comments about how Asta had pushed himself too far once again. Lemiel expresses his gratitude for their help with dealing with the devil, while also thinking about how they used the power of another devil. Noelle and Mimosa wonder who Lemiel and Secre are, even though Lemiel looks like the statue of the first magic emperor. Asta reveals that Lemiel is the first magic emperor and expresses that he will become a great magic emperor just like Lemiel. Asta says that Secre is Nero, which Noelle wonders if Asta had hit his head somewhere. Secre says that Asta is correct, which Noelle is shocked by this. Asta expresses how amazing Secre is for being able to transform into a human, which Secre reveals that she was originally a human. Asta wonders why she did not say anything, which Secre says that she did not get a chance to talk to Asta until they escaped from the Shadow Palace. Secre then pinches Asta's cheek for talking so brazenly to Lemiel, which Asta tells her to stop and how she is still the Nero that he knows. Noelle thinks about how Secre is the same cute Nero, but she is now cute in a different way.<br><br>Mimosa heals Asta after the battle.<br><br>Lemiel's body starts to crumble, which Lemiel says that his mana is starting to run out. Noelle, Mimosa, and Asta are shocked by this, which Mimosa wonders if her magic can help. Lemiel asks Secre to do her part in guiding the kingdom towards their ideal, but Secre expresses her desire to stay with Lemiel forever. Lemiel says that it was because of Secre that he was able to protect the future and that he does not want to close the door on any of her potential. Lemiel also says that he is looking forward to the future of the clover kingdom that they have protected. Lemiel thinks about how he feels such content that he was able to meet his own descendants. Secre tells Lemiel that she was happy being able to serve him, which Lemiel says that it was the same for him and thanks her for all her hard work. Asta, Mimosa, Noelle, and Secre then watch as Lemiel's body crumbles away.[140]<br><br>A day later, Julius and Yami call together a meeting with Asta, Noelle, Mimosa, and Secre, who are all uncertain about who the kid is. Julius explains that the kingdom is faced with three problems. The first is the lack of a Magic Emperor. Yami points that Julius is the kid, surprising the others. Julius explains that his magic power and grimoire are limited and that his influence with the nobles has weakened. When Asta inquires about how Julius survived and became younger, Julius further explains that he found an ancient magic tool and combined the Swallowtail marking with his Time Magic to store additional time. He also comments that it did not work out perfectly, which Yami counters saying that it is unusual to get a second chance at life. After exchanging pleasantries with Asta and asking about Secre's magic, Julius apologizes and says that the last two problems are very closely related. The second problem is that a foreign nation will destroy the Clover Kingdom if it does not change. Asta wonders if it could be the Diamond Kingdom or another country. Julius then says that the last problem is that Asta will die and that both could happen. Asta and Noelle are left stunned by the revelation of the last problem. As Julius explains that the power inside of Asta's grimorie belongs to another devil and explains what the curse of Weg is, Noelle and Mimosa both ask Asta if he is alright, with him stating that he is fine but that all of his muscles ache, with Mimosa pointing out that that does not count as being fine. Julius then explains further about the other three kingdoms, saying that the Spade Kingdom was the one likely to attack, and that the Magic Parliament will need to blame the devil for the recent events and that Asta is the perfect scapegoat for this. Asta is confused who the Magic Parliament is, to which Julius replies, and then tells them that they are currently controlled by House Kira, shocking Noelle and Mimosa.<br><br>The Black Bulls crash the trial.<br><br>A few days after the elves are exorcised, the Black Bulls barge into the Magic Parliament Courthouse to rescue Asta and Secre.[141] Damnatio shrinks the squad's spells, but Asta uses the Demon-Destroyer Sword's ability to remove the effect.

Dorothy asks if Nozel had asked her to come, which Noelle says yes and asks about her mother and the devils. Dorothy leaves three of her squad members to finish the cleanup effort. She then pulls Noelle into her Glamour World so that they can discuss in secret and safety. Dorothy initially teases Noelle with a copy of Asta, which Noelle blasts away. Dorothy then creates a copy of Nozel and reveals that Acier died because of a devil's curse. She explains that the curse will kill anyone who speaks of it in the outside world, so Nozel could never tell his siblings. She further explains how devils manifest in the living world and warns that their influence has been spreading.[143]<br><br>After learninga more during their mission to investigate devils, the Black Bulls discover a powerful curse in the Heart Kingdom, so Asta and Noelle visit Mimosa at the Golden Dawn's Base to ask her about her trip there as a student.

They travel by boat, and after passing through the barrier, they are greeted by Gadjah, whom Mimosa remembers from her previous visit. He hands them crimson orange juice and tells them the history of the Heart Kingdom while the Princess uses her Water Magic to move the boat across the kingdom. Suddenly water traps Asta in a ball and whisks him away. Mimosa questions Gadjah's motive, to which he replies that it is for the sake of peace. Noelle says that they have to head after Asta, which Finral tells them to leave it to him.<br><br>After the three jump off the ship, Finral uses Fallen Angel Flapping to warp Noelle, Mimosa, and himself further out over the forest. Gadjah catches up to Finral blindingly fast. Before Gadjah can catch Finral, Noelle protects him with Sea Dragon's Nest. Finral opens a portal to escape the defense and notices that Gadjah is hovering in midair without using magic.<br><br>Noelle clads herself in her Valkyrie Dress and challenges Gadjah, who accepts.[144] Gadjah fires a lightning bolt from his hand and commands it to follow Noelle when she tries to dodge. Before it can hit Noelle, Finral warps it away and Mimosa fires her Magic Cannon Flower, which misses Gadjah. He then creates a magic circle in the sky and summons a large storm cloud.[145] The trio escape from the large lightning strike with Spatial Magic and hide from sight a distance away. Mimosa uses her Magic Flower Guidepost to locate Gadjah so that Finral can open a portal behind the Spirit Guardian and Noelle can hit him with a Sea Dragon's Roar through the portal.[146] Gadjah manages to deflect the spell with a defensive magic circle on his body. He senses their location and quickly flies over to them, catching them by surprise. Instead of attacking, Gadjah kneels and apologizes, admitting that it was to test their magical skills.[147] Gadjah then escorts the Magic Knights to the Princess's throne room, where the Princess Lolopechka introduces herself and then asks the mages for assistance. After explaining the situation with her curse and with the Spade Kingdom, the Princess asks for the Clover Kingdoms help, explaining that they needed the power of Asta and Secre, who are both Arcane Stage mages.<br><br>Lolopechka tells them that she will share any information she has access to, if they would lend their power in order to defeat the Devil. Noelle says that they cannot decide that on their own, which Asta says that they should ask Yami with the artifact they have. Once they get in contact with Yami, but he tells them to leave him alone since he is in the bathroom. Mimosa says that she figured something like this might happen, so she borrowed an artifact in order to get in contact with Marcus. When they get in contact with Marcus, he asks what is the matter but suddenly notices the princess. Suddenly Julius butts in to look at the princess, and asks her what kind of magic she uses. Marcus tells Julius to not butt in on his own since he is small right now, which Asta says that Lolopechka already knows about Julius's situation.<br><br>After explaining the situation to Julius, Julius says that he is fine with it and even wants to join in. After the alliance is officially established, Lolopechka reveals that the devil, Megicula, has made the Spade Kingdom its home, and is using the people of that kingdom to build up and accumulate power in order to attack and vanquish the Clover, Heart, and other kingdoms.[148] Lolopechka says that she will be killed by the curse in a year, and how she wants to launch a preemptive attack on the Spade Kingdom. Lolopechka also says that their time limit is half a year, and that they need as much military strength as they can get. Lolopechka tells them to assemble as many people capable of fighting against the devil as they can find, since the Heart Kingdom's Spirit Guardians will make them stronger. Lolopechka says that she wants them to train with them and fight with them in six months, which the Clover Kingdom agrees to.<br><br>During the six months of training, Lolopechka trains Noelle, Mimosa, and Secre with a focus on the plans and tactics she developed after facing Vanica and Megicula.[149][150]<br><br>Six months later in the Heart Kingdom, the Magic Knights are assembled to deal with the oncoming mobile fortress sent by the Spade Kingdom. The Magic Knights strategize about their counterattack, and Lolopechka worriedly informs them about how the enemies are mistreating their own people. Hearing this, Asta suddenly takes off from the meeting, and as others worry about what to do next, Lolopechka smiles and says that it is better for him to go attack now. Later after Asta defeats all of the Spade Kingdom soldiers, Noelle reaches the Candelo with Finral and Mimosa traveling with her inside one of her spells. As she releases her spell, she ends up dousing Asta and Finral in water. Noelle complains on how hard it was on her to maintain a transport spell in Grand Magic Zone and inquires Asta on leaving them behind, with Noelle thinking to herself about mostly being upset that he left without her. Noticing the woman who was assaulted by the Spade soldier, Finral tries to flirt with her but backs off as he remembers that Finesse Calmreich is the only one for him, with Noelle bluntly stating her surprise at Finral's behavior, stating that she's surprised that he's even engaged at all. With Mimosa healing the rescued people, Noelle notices that the people are still sad, since they have lost their home to the soldiers. The woman replies that the soldiers were cruel enough to kill the people who resisted and they will be killed immediately even if they return. Noelle smiles and asks them not to worry as Leopold Vermillion and Luck Voltia have headed to the town to defeat the spade soldiers.<br><br>With Luck and Leopold informing everyone that they succeeded in saving the town, Finral marks the current location and heads to the town. The woman inquires what they are going to do to the town since they need to obey the strong in order to live. Asta smilingly replies that it is their town and that the Magic Knights will not be doing anything, and informs them that Finral will teleport them all back, which delights the prisoners. Asta says that their role is to defeat the devil in the Spade Kingdom. The woman reveals that the Spade Kingdom is currently being ruled by mages known as the Dark Triad and how their strength is almost like that of a devil.<br><br>In the Royal Palace of the Heart Kingdom, Lolopechka thanks everyone for successfully completing their mission and guarantees the safety of Tolon, the town which they liberated. Lolopechka adds that as they gain more Spade Kingdom territory, the will corner the devils. Although it is a difficult task, Noelle Silva feels hopeful since they have Lolopechka's support. The Magic Knights discuss what to do next. Asta, Luck Voltia, and Leopold Vermillion wish to spar with Gadjah. Lolopechka wants to join the training but trips and falls. Noelle suggests they have a bath since they returned from a long travel to a Grand Magic Zone. Lolopechka, Noelle, Mimosa, and Secre decide to go for a bath but a villager rushes in for help, stating that Charmy has appeared in the Polnfrume Forest. Finral Roulacase steps in to take care of the situation, but Asta convinces him that he can take care of it. Asta summons the Demon-Slayer Sword and flies off from the castle, while Finral reflects on how much Asta has improved. At Elmora Lake, the women bathe, discuss dating, and also speak on how fortunate they are to have met each other.<br><br>Later in her underground chamber, Lolopechka dotes on Charmy, feeding her fruits, upsetting Noelle who asks the princess not to pamper her after what she did. The knights are then interrupted when the Princess senses people infiltrate her barrier. She creates a map showing the intruders' locations and realizes that one of them is Vanica.[151] While using her Mana Zone to evacuate and protect her citizens, Lolopechka notices that four of the Spirit Guardians have been defeated. She panics and decides to withdraw those she sent to support the Spirit Guardians, but Noelle convinces her to let them handle the fighting.[152]<br><br>When Vanica and a Dark Disciple reach the underground chamber, Lolopechka has Undine boost Mimosa's Magic Cannon Flower to defeat the Disciple with one shot. Vanica enters after her Disciple, and Lolopechka questions why Vanica attacked the citizens when the Princess is the Dark Triad's goal. Vanica explains that she wishes to further motivate the Princess, which distresses Lolopechka. After Noelle points out that they have defeated all of Vanica's Disciples, they are shocked to see the Disciple stand back up, and Vanica explains and demonstrates that her Disciples will continue to resurrect due to a curse. Lolopechka then worries about all the others as the Disciples stand back up uninjured. When Vanica reveals that defeating her will end the re </div>

<p>
The Superhero Database Classification number, or SHDB Class, is a number that represents the overall 'power' of a character. All traits of a character are used for calculating the Classification.
</p>
<h5>What it DOESN'T mean</h5>
<p>
This doesn't mean that a higher class would always beat a lower class character. But the bigger the difference in Class is, the more obvious it is who'll win in a fight.
</p>
<h5>How is this calculated</h5>
<pre class="footnote">( INT^1.3 + (STR*0.5 )^2 + (SPE*0.5)^2 + DUR^1.6 + (POW + (SPS*SPL))^2 + COM^1.8 ) ^ TIER</pre>
<h6>Super Power Score and Level</h6>
<p>Every Super Power has a score (SPS) that is used to calculate the Class. Each Super Power also has 3 levels (SPL). The level is set when connecting that Super Power to a character. The level determines the final score, of the Super Power, being used in the calculation.
