<h3>Android 17's History</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
Android 17 was originally a human named Lapis, and the younger of he and his twin sister Lazuli. The twins were notorious delinquents, who Dr. Gero would meet by chance while looking for fresh material for his experiments. He then kidnapped them and restructured them into Android 17 and Android 18.<br><br>However, despite being referred to as androids or cyborgs and commonly regarded as such, both Android 17 and his sister are practically neither. Bulma stated while looking at 17's blueprint that he was human-based, but just about everything has been enhanced with bio-organic components. His only mechanical parts are the emergency deactivation controller and self-destruction device (removed). Dragon Ball Super reaffirms this, with Gohan stating that the androids have been modified on cellular level to be superhuman.<br><br>With Android 17 and his sister Android 18, Dr. Gero reverted to the old way which consisted in modifying a human being with cybernetic implants. However, they are the first of their kind to be entirely restructured at the cellular level thanks to bio-technology and genetic engineering. Their power comes from a small perpetual energy reactor internalized within their bodies, which provides them with inexhaustible energy and stamina. Since they are human-based, they can become stronger if they train. Though they do not require food to sustain themselves, they still need to hydrate. They also age much slower than normal humans, due to the slower rate of decay of the artificial cells in their bodies. Gero's experiments on him do not impede his ability to reproduce, as evidenced by the child he had brought about with his wife.<br><br><h4>Androids Saga</h4>
Android 17 and his twin sister Android 18 are awakened by Dr. Gero when he is pressed into a desperate situation by the Z Fighters, who have surpassed his expectations because of the intense training they endured after Gero collected their statistic data. Initially, 17 and 18 feigned obedience to the doctor because he carried an emergency Shut Down Remote as a fail-safe against them. Soon after, the Z Fighters arrive and attempt to break into the doctor's laboratory. This momentarily distracts Gero, and 17 steals the remote from him. Much to Gero's horror, 17 crushes the remote and tells Gero that he will not put them to sleep again.<br><br>Suddenly, Vegeta blasts the door down and the androids are surrounded by the Z Fighters. Dr. Gero tells 17 and 18 to kill the Z Fighters, mentioning that they destroyed Android 19 and almost killed him. Android 17 asks if 19 was an energy absorption model and the one who converted him into android, and Gero replies that he was. Android 18 asks if Gero went back to the old energy absorption model on a more recent android because infinite energy models like she and 17 were too powerful to control. Dr. Gero tells them that it does not matter now, and orders the pair to kill the Z Fighters, but 17 says that they will fight when they want. Gero is even more upset when Android 18 begins inspecting a chamber labeled "16". 18 notices that 16 is also an infinite energy model and asks how the android inside is different from them, but Gero tells her to get away from 16's chamber. Android 17 and Android 18 want to activate him but Dr. Gero adamantly refuses. Fed up with the mad scientist, 17 murders Gero by impaling and decapitating him before stepping on his living head. Android 17 again tells Android 18 to activate Android 16, but a desperate Future Trunks says that he will not let there be any more androids, and transforms into a Super Saiyan before firing a Buster Cannon into the lab. When the smoke clears, Gero's lab is destroyed. However, Vegeta tells Trunks that the blast was pointless, as Android 17, Android 18, and the chamber containing Android 16 have survived.<br><br>Android 17 suggests they open the chamber at once, as its support systems were disconnected. Once he is activated, Android 17 asks Android 16 what it feels like to be free for the first time in years, and tells him that Dr. Gero warned them not to activate him, saying he would destroy them all. Android 18 asks what Gero meant, but Android 16 does not respond. Android 17 then asks Android 16 whether he does not want to tell them or whether he is just the strong, silent type, but Android 16 still says nothing. Android 17 then asks if Android 16 was created to kill Goku, and Android 16 simply says yes. Android 17 says that he hates the idea of following Gero's programming, but feels that they need a sense of purpose. 17 and 18 decide to find and challenge Goku; not because they have been commanded to do so, but merely as a form of entertainment. The three androids leave the ruined laboratory to find Goku, ignoring the present Z Fighters.<br><br>As the androids pass over a mountain road, Android 17 decides to land, and Android 18 and Android 16 follow suit. Android 18 asks why they have landed, and Android 17 says that there is no rush, and they might as well enjoy the trip. 18 asks if they are going to walk, but 17 says that when a car passes by, they will take it. 18 says that Android 17 is still part human, as he has the male love of pointless amusement. 17 asks Android 16 if he understands, since he was created from a human male too. Android 16 then reveals that he was never a human, making him fundamentally different from Android 17 and Android 18. 17 is surprised that Gero had the capability to make a true android, and wonders why he returned to cybernetics afterwards. When Vegeta in his Super Saiyan form intercepts the trio, 17 and 18 implore 16 to step in and fight, interested to see him in action, as that was their main purpose for activating him in the first place. However, Android 16 refuses to fight him, thus prompting Android 18 to volunteer. Throughout the battle, Vegeta gains some hits, but Android 18 keeps with him blow for blow. 17 notes that Vegeta is much stronger than what Dr. Gero's data indicated, and is impressed with his fighting abilities. When Android 18 overpowers Vegeta in the fight, Future Trunks, Krillin, Piccolo and Tien Shinhan arrive as Vegeta's reinforcement. Android 17 takes the opportunity to ask if Android 16 will join the fight, though, as he initially assumed, Android 16 would once again opt out. When Vegeta tells Android 18 that he would rather die alone than accept assistance from Goku and his friends, Android 17 tells the Z Fighters to respect the code of the warrior and not interfere with Android 18 and Vegeta's battle and promises to deal with anyone who does.<br><br>When 18 breaks Vegeta's arm during the battle, Future Trunks breaks Android 17's non-interference truce because he could not bear to see Vegeta injured. 17 intervenes and fights against Trunks, dealing one hard hit to his head, almost knocking him out. Seeing this, Piccolo and Tien Shinhan fly towards the battle as well. Android 17 sees Piccolo coming towards him and kicks the Namekian out of his way. 17 also puts Tien in a headlock when the latter tries to punch him. Having gotten back up, Vegeta attempts to fly towards Android 17 and Tien, but Android 18 grabs his foot. As 17 chokes Tien, Trunks gets back up and runs toward Android 18, who swings Vegeta into him, sending them both to the ground. 17 lets go of Tien and then effortlessly defeats Piccolo, dealing a single blow that nearly tears through the latter. Vegeta manages to get up and and fires a Ki Blast at Android 18 with his good arm, however, 18 dodges the blast and flies over to Vegeta before giving him rough beating and ending the fight by breaking his other arm, causing him to lose consciousness and revert to his base form. Android 17 notes that Vegeta's hair has changed back to its black color and his glow is gone, and says that the transformation was very weird. Android 18 notes that the 'other guy' (Future Trunks) was the same way, and 17 wonders who he was, as they have no data on him. He and 18 then fly back up to the road and land near Krillin, frightening him. 17 tells him that the others are still alive, and that he should feed them some Senzu Beans right away. He then tells a speechless Krillin that they will fight the Z Fighters whenever they feel up to it. 18 asks if he will inquire about Goku's location. 17 says that it will be more fun to find it on their own, and that maybe even Goku will look for them. The pair then meet up with Android 16, who is still nearby, looking off into the distance. 17 asks what he is looking at, and 16 simply says that the birds flew away because they were too loud. 17 seems confused by this, and 18 suggests they fly to someplace where more cars will pass by.<br><br>The androids decide to go to the nearest town to get 18 some more clothes, (as her outfit was damaged by Vegeta), and to find a car. As they are about to leave, Krillin rushes over to them, telling them to wait. Android 17 asks what he wants, and Krillin asks if they just want to kill Goku, or take over the world. 17 says that for now they are just going to kill Goku, and will decide what to do next afterwards. Krillin asks why they want to kill Goku, since it was Dr. Gero who hated him, and he is now dead. 17 replies that Gero has nothing to do with it and that it is just a game, which is why he did not ask Krillin where Goku is. Krillin asks if they would leave Goku alone if he begged them, but Android 16 replies that they would not, they were created to kill Goku. 17 agrees, and tells Krillin hurry and give his friends some Senzu Beans. Android 18 then kisses Krillin on the cheek, and the androids fly off.<br><br>This is one of many examples that set Android 17 and Android 18 apart from their future timeline counterparts, especially considering how much stronger they are in the mainstream timeline than in Future Trunks' future.<br><br><h4>Cell Saga</h4>
As they fly over a snowy area in the north, the androids spot a Lucky Foods van parked along the road next to a rest stop, while two Lucky Foods workers are drinking coffee. The trio land to check it out. The workers notice and attempt to stop the Androids, but are frightened when Android 16 lifts the van and dumps out its cargo. The androids then drive off, and Android 17 plans to head to Goku's House. Android 18 reminds him that she wants new clothes first, and 17 agrees to take care of that first. As they drive, Android 18 asks Android 17 if he even knows where Goku's House is, and 17 says that he doesn't and has been driving on pure instinct. Android 16 then chimes in with the house's coordinates, and says they can be there in a few minutes if they fly. 18 agrees with flying there, but 17 says that small things in life are what make it fun.<br><br>17 informs 18 that they are about to enter a town and he will stop to get her some clothes. Suddenly, two police officers follow them and order them to stop. The androids exit the vehicle and are promptly arrested for stealing the van. The androids are handcuffed by the officers, but 16 easily breaks them off of his wrists and 18 throws the police car into a nearby mountain. 17 and 18 remove their cuffs and the trio continues on their way, leaving the terrified officers behind. Once they reach the town, Android 18 goes into a store to get more some clothes. She chooses a cowgirl outfit, which she says looks hideous but is the best she can expect from a backwater place. She leaves without paying, and the androids drive off as the store owner bangs on their van. He then calls the police, and soon police cars begin to pursue the androids' van. Android 18 flies out and punches the cars, causing them to crash into each other.<br><br>As the trio drives to Goku's home, Android 17 suddenly comes to a stop. He and Android 18 get out, and Android 17 asks if she felt a change in the atmospheric pressure. 18 says that she did, and Android 16 says that it came from the outskirts of West City. He then says that two organics with powerful ki are fighting. Android 17 says that he never told them he was equipped with a Power Radar, but Android 16 replies that he never asked. Android 17 asks who is fighting, but Android 16 says neither are in his databanks, although one of them rivals Android 17 in power. Android 17 says that his Power Radar is malfunctioning, as no one rivals him in power. The androids then decide to continue onwards, unaware that the combatants are Piccolo, who recently fused with Kami, and Cell, the ultimate creation of Dr. Gero created from the genes of the most powerful warriors to walk the Earth.<br><br>As they ride, Android 16 tells 17 and 18 that one of the powers he felt earlier was losing energy (This is the result of Cell absorbing energy from Piccolo) and the fight seems to have reached a conclusion. Android 17 gets cocky and again says that 16's sensors need to be re-calibrated because no one can match their power. Later, 18 tells 17 that she doesn't like her new outfit and when they reach another town, she wants to stop to find more clothes, which 17 reluctantly agrees to, while 16 curiously observes a nearby river.<br><br>Eventually, the Androids arrive at Mount Paozu, where they are forced to drive through the dense, forest area to reach Goku's house. Android 18 makes it clear that she is uncomfortable driving through the forest's bumpy terrain, while Android 17 seems to enjoy the ride. 18 asks Android 16 how close is Goku's house, which he says is directly ahead. 18, tired of driving through the bumpy terrain, opens her window and unleashes an energy blast that obliterates the entire forest in front of them and makes the ground more even. 17 is disappointed by 18's actions and says that he just wanted to have some fun and enjoy the ride. 18 says that fun is for humans and they aren't human anymore, which causes 16 and 17 to sadly stay silent. When the androids finally arrive at Goku's House, they find it completely deserted (Due to the Dragon Team anticipating this and evacuating a sick Goku days prior). In the anime, 18 goes through Chi-Chi's clothes to find a new outfit, while in the manga, her clothes are already changed prior to their arrival at Goku's home. 17 asks 16 if he knows where Goku might be, and 16 replies that he could either be at Capsule Corporation or at Kame House. The trio decide to fly to Kame House, the closer of the two locations.<br><br>The next day, at Kame House, Piccolo watches the news of Cell's attacks on TV while Krillin, Yamcha, and Tien sleep. Suddenly, Piccolo senses that something is amiss, and sees the trio of androids standing outside Kame House, much to his horror. Android 16 states that Goku is not here, which disappoints 17. Piccolo wakes up the others, and Android 17 asks where Goku is, saying that he will use force to make them talk if necessary (Unbeknownst to the androids, Goku, who recovered from his illness, took Gohan, Vegeta, and Future Trunks to The Lookout on the previous day to train in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber in order to gain the power to kill the androids). Piccolo replies that he wants to see Android 17 try, and says they should go to an uninhabited island nearby where they can fight. After telling the others to stay at Kame House, Piccolo and the androids fly over. Once they land, 17 gives Piccolo one last chance to them where Goku is, but the brave Namekian is not intimidated and tells the cocky android that he will not go down so easy this time.<br><br>With the power boost he gained from fusing with Kami, Piccolo hopes that he can kill at least one of the twins and prevent Imperfect Cell from absorbing both of his targets and achieving his perfect form, which would spell doom. Android 17 accepts Piccolo's challenge and decides to fight him one-on-one, rather than fight with Android 18, vastly increasing Piccolo's chance to win. Piccolo appears to have the upper hand in the battle until Android 17 confesses that he had been holding back and playing with the Namekian. Once both choose to go at full power, they find that they are an even match. Equal in both power and strength; Android 17 had an advantage because of his unlimited energy and speed. Piccolo would match that with his regeneration and variety of energy attacks, such as the Scatter Shot, Explosive Demon Wave, as well as a plethera of other attacks. Android 17 almost gets injured by Piccolo's Hellzone Grenade attack, but he protects himself with an Android Barrier, much to Piccolo's dismay. Android 17 points to a nearby island for them to continue their battle, as Piccolo's attack completely destroyed the island they were fighting on.<br><br>Piccolo and Android 17 descend back to the ground after fighting in the air for a long period of time. Android 17 lands near Android 16 and Android 18, and praises Piccolo for his surprising newfound strength, though he still asks Piccolo to tell him Goku's location. Adamant, Piccolo refuses tell him just so he can kill Goku. Android 17 promises he will not give Piccolo any mercy and flies right in front of the Namekian. The two have a stare down, and Android 17 suddenly attacks Piccolo with the "Now We're Playing for Keeps!" rush, though Piccolo manages to dodge Android 17's last two hits by somersaulting away. Piccolo cracks his stiff neck and compliments Android 17 on his amazing speed, but that his punches are quite lacking in force. 17, angered, tells Piccolo that he was created to be the ultimate warrior. 17 and Piccolo engage each other in another physical battle with neither seeming to gain to upper hand. Piccolo, now getting frustrated his energy is being wasted on useless melee attacks, decides to fire an Explosive Demon Wave to finally disintegrate Android 17. The powerful Android dodges the attack just barely, and starts to lose patience. Piccolo now begins to breathe heavily in tiredness, which makes 17 grin sadistically, reminding Piccolo that he has infinite flowing energy coursing through him. He gloats that it would only be a matter of time before he is powerless.<br><br>Before their fight can continue, Piccolo and 17 are interrupted by the arrival of Cell. Ironically, Cell was able to find Android 17 through the nearby presence of Piccolo, who fought 17 in an effort to impede Cell's progression to perfection. Piccolo growls at the Cell's appearance, regretting that he didn't notice him while he was fighting Android 17. 17 stops his dazing to ask Piccolo what the creature even is, as he notices Piccolo seems to know who, or what, it is. Piccolo becomes surprised at 17's lacking knowledge of Cell, thinking that Cell and the Androids would have been working together. As Cell descends from the higher rocky formation of the island, he begins to charge his ki, which completely decimates the entire rocky mountain area of the island. At this point, his power has far surpassed the weakened Piccolo and Android 17's, and without any precautions, he approaches Android 17. 17 demands that Cell leaves immediately so that he can get back to his battle with Piccolo, but Cell stands silent, raising his tail up. Piccolo realizes Cell is preparing an absorption, and warns 17 to run away immediately. Cell uses his stinger to swipe at 17, who barely dodges it. As 17 continues to quickly dodge Cell's attacks, Cell grabs 17 by his right arm, and throws him into the ground, creating a crack in the ground. Before the Bio-Android can absorb him, Piccolo kicks Cell on the side of its head, knocking him away from 17. As 17 recovers and lifts himself up, he asks Piccolo why the creature needs to absorb him. Piccolo explains that Cell is another of Gero's creations and he needs to absorb him and Android 18 to complete his design. Cell carries on Piccolo's explanation and tells 17 that the power unlocked from the absorption will be beyond comparison, and that Dr. Gero's dreams of creating the ultimate super-being will be fulfilled. 17 denies this, stating that he is Gero's ultimate creation and he won't join with him. Cell replies that the absorption will be carried out, with or without 17's permission. Android 17 prepares to fight, however, finally speaking, Android 16 orders 17 to retreat because Cell is far beyond both him and Piccolo. 16 explains that if Cell obtains his perfect form, killing Goku won't satsify him and he'll destroy the entire universe. Now surprised Android 16 is actually speaking, Android 17 is disappointed that the first thing he speaks about is cowardice.<br><br>Ignoring Android 16's plea, 17 rushes towards Cell with great fury, but Cell effortlessly elbows the confident android into the ground. Piccolo tries to aid in the battle, but he is easily tossed aside. Piccolo stands from his beating, and prepares one last attack: Light Grenade. As Piccolo charges up the Energy Sphere in his palms, Cell slowly approaches the Namekian and doesn't even attempt to dodge, while Android 17 runs away from Piccolo to avoid possibly getting caught in the explosion. Piccolo tells Cell to die and fires the enormous attack, decimating a massive chunk of the island as the Androids watch in awe, except 16. 18 praises Piccolo's power, thinking that Cell was destroyed. However, Android 16 immediately states that Cell wasn't even damaged by the attack. Indeed, Cell slowly rises from the ocean without even a slight visible scar. Piccolo, now distressed and confused as to how even Cell could remain unharmed after that attack, cannot move, clenching his fists in anger over how helpless the situation is. Cell slowly, and mockingly walks towards the devastated Piccolo, as Tien Shinhan, who had just recently arrived, looks in awe over Cell's strength and endurance from a good distance away. Now standing right next to Piccolo, Cell continues to stay silent, looking upon his helpless opponent in a stoic stare. Piccolo suddenly pleads to 17 to run away but Cell brutally disposes the Namekian and tosses him into the ocean as 17 watches in horror.<br><br>While Android 17 is struggling to defend himself, Android 16 steps in to fight Cell. 16 is able to hold Cell off for some time by repeatedly surprising him with intense attacks. After Cell fails to absorb his energy, 16 steps on the Bio-Android's tail and literally tears it off of his body to prevent him from absorbing 17 and 18. However, Cell was able to regrow his tail thanks to his partial Namekian DNA, which makes 16 realize that he must destroy Cell completely so he will not achieve his perfect form. 16 punches Cell to the ground, then grabs him and raises him overhead. He angrily throws Cell to the ground, creating a deep hole and attempts to finish him off with Hell's Flash as Tien Shinhan and the other androids continue to stare in shock. 16 notices that Android 18 is still there, and says that he told her to run. 18 says that will not be necessary now that Cell has been defeated, but 16 says she is wrong. He says that Cell, while injured, will not die so easily. He again implores 17 and 18 to escape, but 17 refuses, saying that he wants payback and can now finish a wounded Cell. As 17 taunts Cell to come back out, Cell begins to emerge from the ground behind him. Tien notices Cell's plan and yells out to 17, but Cell quickly emerges and begins to absorb the android with his tail, triggering his transformation into Semi-Perfect Cell.<br><br>Shortly afterwards, Semi-Perfect Cell alters his voice and poses as Android 17 in an attempt to convince Android 18 to let herself be absorbed. 18's resolve seems to waver, but a damaged Android 16 warns her that it is merely a trick. Cell retorts to Android 16 that a robot cannot understand how he and Android 18 feel, and that he should not interfere and continues in his attempt to manipulate 18. Cell almost succeeds, but makes the mistake of saying that if she joins him, they will be able to fulfill the "great" Dr. Gero's wishes. 18 then realizes that it was not Android 17 speaking, as she and 17 hated Dr. Gero for experimenting on them and would never praise him.<br><br>17's life is restored after the Z Fighters use the Dragon Balls to revive those who died as a result of Cell's campaign. A second wish made to Shenron by Krillin removes the Android Bombs within Lapis and Lazuli's bodies. Krillin originally intended to use the wish to turn Android 17 and his sister into humans, but this proves beyond Shenron's power. Krillin did this because he thought 17 and 18 were meant to be a couple, until Android 18 angrily corrected him and revealed that 17 was actually her twin brother.<br><br><h4>Interlude</h4>
After the conflict with Cell, Android 17 is reborn in the same place Cell was destroyed thanks to Shenron. He was shortly greeted by his sister who told him he was revived and had his bomb removed thanks to Krillin. The two then part off to live since their mission to kill was no longer necessary, as Goku had been killed when Cell self-destructed.<br><br>Android 17 went on to travel the world, he eventually arrived at Monster Island where he fought a group of poachers and befriended the ranger there. He eventually married the ranger - who is also a zoologist - after becoming a ranger himself.<br><br>Android 17 becomes a park ranger in the wildlife preserve area of a gigantic royal nature park, where he is well paid. He is an outstanding guard who does not hold back against poachers. It is an ideal job for 17, as he loves to be on his own and is not big on cooperating with others. Since he is so good at his job, he takes in a high salary. Android 17 and his wife have one child and two adopted children, and live happily in an isolated house inside the nature park. He went and met 18 and Krillin one time, but did not talk about what he had been up to, possibly because he considers such a wholesome lifestyle embarrassing considering his past behavior.<br><br>In the manga, at some point after the Cell Games, Android 17 tamed the regenerated Cell Juniors and allowed them to live with him on Monster Island.<br><br><h4>Majin Buu Saga</h4>
Super Buu utilized his Human Extinction Attack to kill everyone on Earth, including Android 17 again along with nearly everyone else. While fighting Kid Buu on the Sacred World of the Kai, Vegeta asks Dende to make a wish to Porunga for the Earth and the lives of all its good-willed inhabitants to be restored. The fact that Android 17 was not exempt from this wish, as confirmed by his appearance, is proof of Android 17's inherent goodness.<br><br>Goku is gathering energy for the Super Spirit Bomb in an effort to defeat Kid Buu, and in a mountainous region, Android 17 is walking down a forest trail when he recognizes Goku's voice, then encounters two hunters passing through. Android 17 raises his rifle to trick the two into raising their hands, unaware that they are supplying Goku with their energy. To the hunters' confusion, the android smiles and proclaims "You beat me to it", before raising one of his own hands. The manga-equivalent of this scene does not feature the hunters; Android 17 merely raises his hands to pass on his energy while saying "So it's Goku, huh? I haven't heard that voice in a long time." However, the scene with the hunters is retained in Kai.<br><br><h4>Dragon Ball Super</h4>
While recruiting members for the Tournament of Power, Android 18 is named as a suggestion and Gohan also suggests Android 17. Goku eventually meets with Dende, who personally takes him to the island where 17 is located, also telling Goku that not only is 17 a changed man, rid of the shadow that once inhabited his heart, he is also a lot stronger. Mr. Popo jumps in and tells Goku he has been at the lookout, occupied by the space around him, and telling him that he is not paying attention to what is happening on the Earth.<br><br>Android 17 now works for a wildlife reserve, spending the days protecting animals on the island while constantly fighting off poachers wanting to capture them, along with the rare Minotaurus.<br><br>In the anime, Goku, having met 17 as he is battling more poachers, greets him. Goku states that he knows that 17 is the one he was looking for, because his eyes resemble those of his sister, and 17 replies that they are twins after all. 17 tells Goku that he is free to help him if he wants, after an enormous group of poachers show up, and advises him not to kill anyone.<br><br>After chasing them off, Goku and 17 go explore a cave where the Minotaurus lives, the beast attacks them and 17 begs Goku not to fight back. Gaining the sky, 17 describes the Minotaurus as an endangered species under the Red Data Book, and mentions that this species used to be docile, but evolved to become very hostile to humans because of their constant hunting. The horns of the Minotaurus are highly prized and valued, and that is why Android 17 has to keep fighting off poachers with his own life.<br><br>As the sun goes down, Goku and 17 discuss and reflect each other's past, and they mention how they never had a chance to fight because of Cell absorbing 17. A curious and excited Goku exclaims that he wants to try out Android 17's current strength, and transforms into a Super Saiyan, wanting "strong friends" to aid him in the Tournament of Power, and rushes at him without warning. After a few clashes, and two heavy blows from 17, Goku is overwhelmed, and states he is surprised by 17's new strength. 17 replies that he had not been sitting around by doing nothing. As the fight raged on, 17 shows some concerns about fighting near the forest, after Goku nearly crashed into it after a swift kick by 17, which sent the Saiyan flinging down, worrying 17. Fortunately, Goku stopped at the last second from hitting the nearby trees, to 17's slight relief, and Goku decided to take the fight to the skies to avoid hitting the forest again.<br><br>Goku reveals that he never intended for things to go this far, but finally decides to transform into Super Saiyan Blue. Android 17 was initially annoyed that Goku was condescendingly holding back until Goku asked Android 17 if he was holding back as well, to which 17 replied that he was. Goku wants 17 to go all-out as there is no forest to hold them back now, he then fires a God Kamehameha at Android 17, who blocks it with his Energy Shield. 17 appeared to be struggling with Goku's blast, but, after the blast explodes, obscuring him briefly, he suddenly appears and charges at Goku. Both fighters engage in an evenly, but explosive fist-to-fist clash, both screaming, apparently struggling, after another explosion, they engage in another suspenseful fight, until they end up splashing into the ocean, 17 stops the fight, seeing the dolphins breaching. Worried about their safety, which Goku notices, 17 asks for a break.<br><br>17 comments that his old self would have surely been defeated by Goku if they had fought, but Goku is not quite sure. 17 tells Goku that he knowingly was not serious yet. Goku admits it, but claims 17 is holding back as well. Both of them smile at each other, hinting that both assumptions are indeed correct. Goku is now glad that 17 is a "good guy" now and not an enemy, as he would be a lot of trouble to deal with.<br><br>While having coffee and a small talk, 17 tells Goku about his family, and mentions that he met his wife during his days in his job, and had 1 child with her and adopted 2 others. Goku then brings up the golden question: Will he fight in the Tournament of Power? 17 refuses because he already received a lot of money from his job through salaries, as Goku lied to him about Zeni being the prize, and not being able to leave the island in case more poachers come. Despite Goku offering Trunks and Goten to watch over the island, 17 still refuses, also knowing that Goku is hiding something. Goku tells 17 about being erased should Universe 7 lose, and 17 is not swayed by this news at all, stating that if everyone gets erased then it cannot be helped, ultimately refusing Goku's offer and wishing him good luck in finding someone else.<br><br>In the manga, however, Android 17 accepts to fight in the Tournament of Power after knowing Krillin will participate, as he feels he owes him a debt for asking Shenron to have their bombs removed.<br><br>In the anime, as 17 is leaving, an alien force arrives above space and is hunting the endangered Minotaurus and begins to invade Earth to capture it and take its horns. After the Minotaurus is kidnapped, 17 and Goku are alerted. The pair infiltrate the ship and engage its forces to reclaim the rare animal, with Goku securing the animals and crew while 17 goes for the boss. 17 confronts the boss with Goku not to far behind him, and the boss of the group attempts to bribe them, but 17 refuses and kicks him into the ship window. The boss reveals he has a bomb in his body, and threatens to detonate it if they do not leave.<br><br>17, not having anymore options, tells Goku to apologize to his wife and children for him and entrusts the safety of the animals to him, telling him that he would have really loved to talk some more, and tackles the boss out the window into space, risking his own life in the process. Goku, not wanting 17 to die like this, transforms into Super Saiyan Blue to survive the vacuum of space and uses Instant Transmission, to rescue 17 and the boss. They warp to King Kai's Planet where Goku introduces 17 to King Kai. 17 recalls this was the planet that Cell blew himself up on. Goku reveals to King Kai that he plans on letting the boss self-destruct here to save the animals. While King Kai yells at Goku, saying that he is not a "bomb disposal unit", as Dende interrupts and tells everyone that there is no bomb in the boss and he is revealed to be bluffing. Outraged, 17 angrily tells him to poke the button, the boss claiming that he cannot. 17 angrily demands him to push it and, to everyone's surprise, it just makes confetti rain from his body, claiming he had a birthday party to go to. It is revealed that the galactic patrol and Jaco arrived and assist Goku and 17 in getting the ship and animals back to Earth.<br><br>After Jaco leaves, 17 tells Goku that he will join the team to repay Goku for saving the animals and for his help and is willing to entrust Trunks and Goten to protect the island while he is gone. 17 reflects on the irony that he is on a team with the man he was programmed to kill. Goku tells him otherwise and mentions Tien Shinhan, Piccolo and Vegeta at one point in time were enemies with Goku and now they are all friends. 17 asks if Android 18 and his brother-in-law Krillin, the mini-monk as 17 called him, also apply. Goku confirms this, along with Majin Buu, which shocked 17. After being reassured he is no longer evil, as he is the good half of the evil, pure Kid Buu, 17 is surprised, saying that the savior of the world is turning his old enemies into friends. Shockingly, Goku tells 17 that he has no desire to be a savior, and, as a Saiyan, his only goals are to fight very strong people, but states that he cannot stand seeing innocent people or animals get hurt.<br><br>17 was visited by 18 and her family, they soon leave the island with Trunks, Goten, and Marron looking after the creatures. When arriving at Capsule Corp. he meets the other members of the Universe 7 team, 17 and Piccolo walked towards each-other and the two respectfully shake hands. After Goku brings Frieza to the group, 17 and the others are teleported by Whis to the World of Void. After the Tournament of Power began, 17 (along with Goku, Vegeta, 18, and Frieza) goes off on his own to fight against the other warriors. 17 is seen fighting opponents. 17 witnessed the destruction of Universe 9. He reminds his sister of their infinite energy and tells her to use their infinite energy to their advantage. When Goku was struggling against the Pride Troopers, 17 and 18 came to his rescue. 17 easily dodged Kahseral's attacks. After defeating the Pride Troopers, 17 interrupts the Kamikaze Fireballs' Magical Girl Transformation, only to be criticized by the Fireballs and Top. After the transformation, 17 fights Sanka Ku. He easily dodges her attacks and once he got serious, he knocked both her and her teammate, Vikal out of the arena. 17 then proceeds to fight Brianne de Chateau. 17 then saves Goku from an energy blast volley by Su Roas. Brianne and Su get away, with Android 17 simply saying to go onto the next one.<br><br>Android 17 observes the battle between Goku and Jiren. He alongside all of Team Universe 7 (except Vegeta) donate energy to the Universe 7's Spirit Bomb. After Goku gains access to Ultra Instinct Sign, 17 notes that Goku suddenly overcame the overwhelming difference in power. When Catopesra tries to attack Android 18 from behind, Android 17 catches him and knocks him away. Android 17 and 18 observe the fight between Goku and Kefla. After Goku is cornered by Team Universe 2, Android 17 and 18 go to help him. 17 fights Rozie and knocks her out of the arena. When 17 goes to help 18 against Ribrianne, he is ambushed by Biarra, however he easily defeats him. After 18 defeats Ribrianne, 17 and 18 go help Goku against Zarbuto, Rabanra, and Zirloin, 17 fighting Rabanra. Android 17 alongside 18 and Goku are trapped in the Pretty Black Hole, however Super Saiyan Blue Goku breaks them out of the Hole.<br><br>After Damom knocks Piccolo out of the arena, 17 locates the bug using his hearing and knocks him out of the arena, with Goku's help in the anime.<br><br>After Universe 4 is erased, Team Universe 3 attacks Team Universe 7, 17 alongside 18 fighting Biarra, successfully managing to break his body. After Agnilasa is created, 17 alongside Team Universe 7 engage the giant monster in combat, however they are overwhelmed. He is almost knocked out of the arena, however 18 sacrifices herself and launches 17 back on the arena. Android 17 alongside Goku, Vegeta, Gohan and Frieza engage Agnilasa in a beam struggle, however Agnilasa still manages to overwhelm them. Android 17 sees and damages Agnilasa's energy reactor, giving his teammates the opportunity to knock him out of the arena.<br><br>With only Team Universe 7 and Team Universe 11 remaining, while Goku and Vegeta fight Jiren and Frieza fights Dyspo, Android 17 and Gohan fight Top, however they are at a disadvantage. 17 forms up a plan to knock both himself and Top out of the arena. 17 fights Top hand-to-hand and gets his shoulder dislocated. However he manages to trap himself and Top in an Android Barrier, giving Gohan the opportunity to knock both of them off the arena, however Top was able to free himself. Gohan leaves to help Frieza against Dyspo, leaving Android 17 to fight Top alone. After Gohan sacrifices himself to eliminate Dyspo with the help from Frieza, 17 continues his fight with Top by using his infinite energy to run out the tournament clock. Engaging in a energy clash that draws 17 to the edge of the arena, Golden Frieza blast Top in the back with Crazy Finger Beam, which allows 17 to over power Top and knock him to the edge on the other side of the arena. Abandoning his sense of justice, Top decides to ascend to Destroyer Form. Amused and unfazed by Top's transformation, Frieza attempts to deflect an Energy of Destruction blast by Top, but is overpowered and the arena is split in half. Drawing his attention to 17, Top easily overpowers 17 and almost eliminates Frieza, who is saved by 17 throwing a rock which lands Frieza on an edge of the arena.<br><br>17 engages God of Destruction Top on his own and his attacks prove to be ineffective but, still holding a significant speed advantage over his opponent, uses this to force Top to bury himself in rubble, although it doesn't work for long. 17 is finally caught by Top and bombarded with hundreds of Ki blasts; to 17's credit, he is able to withstand the onslaught. As Top prepared to destroy the area, 17 is saved by Frieza, who attempts to use his psychic powers to no avail. As 17 and Frieza begin to work together to fight Top, Jiren becomes annoyed that Top is struggling with them, so he fires his Power Impact at 17 and Frieza, blasting them away so Top and Jiren can fight Goku and Vegeta. After Vegeta defeats Top, 17 emerges from a large pile of rocks, injured but still in the fight. As Jiren faces down Goku, Vegeta and 17, Jiren congratulates them for making it this far without sacrificing who they are and finally unleashes his full power, quickly overwhelming and knocking out the exhausted Goku and Vegeta, forcing 17 to step in and stand alone against Jiren's full might.<br><br>During the battle, 17 is able to sneak up on Jiren and actually cause him serious damage to his back. Goku now realizes what Jiren's weakness is and that he takes considerable damage from hits if unguarded. Coordinating their attacks, Goku, Vegeta and 17 try again, but are unable to capitalize on the newfound weakness. Eventually, the trio are incapacitated but are saved by Frieza, who dropkicks Jiren in the back of the head and says he is forgetting the rules and is going to just kill Jiren. Jiren blasts Frieza aside, but before he can finish him, he is stopped by 17, who is back up thanks to his infinite energy. Belmod asks what is 17's wish and he mentions he wants to take his family on a cruise, much to Belmod's annoyance. However, 17 asks Jiren what his wish is, saying Jiren only cares about power, so he is just curious. Jiren sorrowfully says even he has a wish. Belmod explains Jiren's origin and 17 realizes what Jiren's wish is. 17 says that while it is quite human of him, he can't erase the past, mocking Jiren for his refusal to accept things as they are. Jiren attacks 17 for mocking his wish, but 17 is able to hold his own and he tells Jiren that his wish won't erase what happened. Jiren throws 17 away and calls everyone weak.<br><br>As Jiren prepares to finish off the Saiyans and 17, 17 jumps in front of them and sets up numerous barriers. Goku and 18 tell 17 to run and save himself, since he can actually stop and hurt Jiren, but 17 declines and tells Goku and Vegeta that he is giving up his wish. He wraps them in a barrier and tells them that he hopes he bought them enough time to heal up a little, smiling at them one last time. 17 tells Jiren that sacrificing himself for others is a very human thing to do and that he actually likes it. 18 screams frantically for 17 to move, but he drops his barrier as it was breaking, and jumps into Jiren's attack, stopping it cold in its tracks. Goku and Vegeta survive and fall to a small platform, with 17 nowhere to be found. 17 had self-destructed to stop Jiren’s attack and save Goku and Vegeta, to buy them time to heal up and finish the fight. Vegeta realizes that 17 had no desire to win the tournament and was only there to sacrifice himself if it came down to it. As Goku and 18 mourn 17, a drained Vegeta pulls himself up and challenges Jiren alone, refueled by 17's sacrifice.<br><br>When Goku and Jiren are both drained from their intense fight, Frieza fires a kiai to save Goku from Jiren's Power Impact, revealing his position. In turn, Android 17, shocking everyone, finally manages to free himself from the stage rubble, revealing that he was alive the entire time, and powers up alongside Frieza to face off against Jiren. 17 initially charges Jiren and is able to fend him off for a bit but is kicked aside. Golden Frieza takes his place and is able to fight the tired Jiren. 17 tries to catch back up to them and as Frieza is knocked back 17 flies in and tackles Jiren and charges the same sneak attack he did before, telling Jiren he is going full power this time. Jiren says it won't work again and 17 says same here and erects his barrier trapping himself and Jiren in the full force of the explosion. as the smoke clears Jiren is standing but quickly vomits and drops to his knee's, once again defeated this time by 17. Frieza walks to up 17 and tells him a bit reckless. 17 said even if it went bad it wasn't a problem with you here and asks Frieza to finish him. As Frieza prepares to kill Jiren with a Death Beam, Top re-sparks Jiren's will to fight and Jiren pushes back Frieza and 17. Goku steps in to help, barely able to stand and the 3 are able to stop the attack.<br><br>Goku and Frieza both charge Jiren as 17 provides long-range ki attacks to lock Jiren down. The trio is able to overwhelm Jiren but Jiren breaks free from Goku and Frieza, and attacks 17, forcing the heavily injured 17 to defend himself. Goku throws Frieza to Jiren who uses his Nova Strike to pull him off of 17 and through the floor. Goku joins Frieza as a Super Saiyan and eliminates Jiren with Frieza, leaving 17 as the winner of the Tournament of Power. 17 makes a very noble wish to bring back all the universe that were erased and asks them to hurry as he has a forest to go back and protect. The Grand Priest smiles in approval and makes the wish and reveals that if it was a selfish wish the Omni-kings instead would have erase everything in existence. As the wish is made 18 flies to him and hugs him and asks what about his cruise and 17 says saving multiple universes is nothing compared to his job as a park ranger.<br><br>In the manga, 17 briefly battles Dyspo, who retreats in an attempt to save Top. As Frieza strand Dyspo and Top on a rock far from the arena, Jiren takes notice and attack 17 and Frieza, prompting Frieza to attack Jiren while Dyspo and Top fall off the stage. Before Jiren can deal an apparently final blow against Frieza, 17 comes to his defense, blocking the blow, and tells Frieza to let him take the lead with a tactic. He declares Jiren impossible to beat in a head-on fight, and asks 18 and Krillin to look after his kids, with Krillin asking if he knows what 17 means, and 18 stoically agreeing. 17 asks Jiren if he's fighting for the wish or his universe's survival, to which Jiren declares both. 17 says the same, but states he will give up on the latter, and that he doesn't want to lose his universe, his planet, or his family, before evidently blowing himself up and taking out part of the ring to everyone's shock and despair, with Jiren standing on the edge of where the stage was destroyed.<br><br>Jiren, displeased, demeans his actions, while Goku, downtrodden by 17's apparent loss, puts his emotions aside and then activates Ultra Instinct once again. Later, when Frieza takes himself, Jiren, and Goku out of the ring, 17 finally reveals himself as still alive as part of a plan between him and Frieza, to everyone's bewilderment, his lack of ki rendering him imperceptible to even the Grand Minister and Omni-Kings, along with the reveal that Krillin's wish removed his ability to self-destruct. Being the winner of the tournament, and truly allowed any wish, 17 chooses to wish back all the universes, and also raises Universe 7's mortal level in the process. On the trip back to Universe 7, 17 explains his reasoning for changing his wish was so as to not let the Omni-Kings, (referred to as imps by 17, to Shin's incredulity) have their way. Vegeta promises 17 can have one of Bulma's ships, as thanks for being the universe's savior. When everyone says their goodbyes, Goku expresses enthrallment at how strong 17 became doing nothing but defending his island, before Bulma says he can at least hold a job, having been angered by Vegeta's promise to 17.<br><br>In the anime, 17 is later seen on Bulma's personal cruise ship, checking in with 18 and Krillin, having been given his cruise for saving Universe 7. <br><br><h4>Galactic Patrol Prisoner Saga</h4>
Android 17 along with his sister show up suddenly on the battlefield during Moro's initial assault on Earth. Kicking one of the enemy in the face, he asks if it was Seven-Three who he kicked and after affirming that it was, says that he seems pretty weak and asks Piccolo if he is even needed. Piccolo is glad to see him there however due to the androids not having Chi that can be absorbed by Seven-Three using Moro's ability. Android 17 and Android 18 then prepare to fight Seven-Three and Shimorekka with Android 18 saying that she is there because she is being paid to which Android 17 says makes them sound like mercenaries.<br><br>Android 17 proceeds to completely overwhelm Seven-Three with a barrage of physical attacks. However Moro shows up and the battle is put to an end. Saganbo steps forward and asks if he can take care of them as Moro shares some of his power with him. Saganbo charges forward and throws a punch at Android 17 which drives him backwards. The others join in to assist him but still find themselves overpowered as Saganbo slams Android 17 and Gohan's head into the ground.<br><br>Later on, he watches the battles from the sidelines, realising that Goku has returned and is currently fighting Moro. However Goku loses the battle and is almost finished off leading Android 17 along with Android 18 to save him. The two tell Moro that they do not have life energy to be absorbed and proceed to attack him, performing the Super Electric Strike that barely leaves a mark. The brief battle is put to an end with the re-appearance of Vegeta who states that it is his turn to fight Moro. Unfortunately, Moro acquires even greater strength and Android 17 is forced to intervene again along with his sister but they are taken down before they even have a chance to land an attack.<br><br>Ultimately, after one final push, owed to Uub, Goku defeats Moro once and for all. Android 17 and the rest of his friends and family celebrate their hard earned victory afterwards with a feast at Satan House. </div>

<p>
The Superhero Database Classification number, or SHDB Class, is a number that represents the overall 'power' of a character. All traits of a character are used for calculating the Classification.
</p>
<h5>What it DOESN'T mean</h5>
<p>
This doesn't mean that a higher class would always beat a lower class character. But the bigger the difference in Class is, the more obvious it is who'll win in a fight.
</p>
<h5>How is this calculated</h5>
<pre class="footnote">( INT^1.3 + (STR*0.5 )^2 + (SPE*0.5)^2 + DUR^1.6 + (POW + (SPS*SPL))^2 + COM^1.8 ) ^ TIER</pre>
<h6>Super Power Score and Level</h6>
<p>Every Super Power has a score (SPS) that is used to calculate the Class. Each Super Power also has 3 levels (SPL). The level is set when connecting that Super Power to a character. The level determines the final score, of the Super Power, being used in the calculation.
