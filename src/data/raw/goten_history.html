<h3>Goten's History</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
Goten is the second son of Chi-Chi and Goku, and younger brother to Gohan. He is born in late Age 767, roughly nine months after the defeat of Cell in the Cell Games Saga. As Goku dies during the Cell Games, unaware Chi-Chi is pregnant, Goten does not meet his father Goku until he reaches the age of seven. Goten is not pushed in school as much as Gohan is, and instead is trained in martial arts by Chi-Chi. The reasons for this are never fully explained, but it seems to have something to do with Goku's death. Goten is incredibly strong as a child, far stronger than either Goku or Gohan ever were at his age. Chi-Chi first discovers that Goten can become a Super Saiyan at only seven years old, and he looks almost exactly like Goku when he first transformed into a Super Saiyan.<br><br><h4>Great Saiyaman Saga</h4>
Goten's first appearance in the series is when he is seven years old. Discovering that his father, Goku, will be returning to Earth for a day to compete in the 25th World Martial Arts Tournament, he trains with his older brother, Gohan, for the event, a section of the training was throwing rocks at Gohan, which Gohan could barely dodge even as a Super Saiyan, showing Goten's amazing power. During this training, it is discovered that Goten has already mastered the transformation of Super Saiyan, and ironically, it is also discovered that Goten is not able to fly. Gohan trains Goten in fighting and flight, along with his friend, Videl.<br><br><h4>World Tournament Saga</h4>
Goten meets his father Goku for the first time at the tournament after Goku points that the child looks exactly like him. Goten quickly embraces his father. Goten then competes in the Junior Division. After defeating Ikose and his younger brother, respectively, Goten and his best friend, Trunks, both make it to the finals. The two powerful, young Saiyan warriors place rules limiting their powers during the fight, prohibiting their Super Saiyan transformations. Trunks comes out victorious, due to transforming, using his left arm, and firing an energy blast from his left hand which knocked Goten out of the ring, all three of which Trunks said he would not do, though Goten also became a Super Saiyan earlier in the fight.<br><br>With the two boys wanting more of a challenge, they disguise themselves and enter the Adult Division, as Mighty Mask. After Gohan is attacked, and the Dragon Team pursues the attackers, Goten and Trunks fight Android 18 and Mr. Satan in a battle royale. During the fight Goten and Trunks transform into Super Saiyan and Android 18 quickly realizes what is going on. They are disqualified when Android 18 exposes them by destroying their costume.<br><br><h4>Majin Buu Saga</h4>
Goten and Trunks quickly leave and are informed by Videl that Gohan and the others are in pursuit of an evil wizard named Babidi who is attempting to awaken his monster named Majin Buu. Excited at the idea of seeing a wizard they quickly race off to see him.<br><br>Goten and Trunks fly toward Babidi's spaceship, and, upon arrival, see that Piccolo and Krillin have been turned to stone by Dabura. Trunks accidentally breaks Piccolo's statue, and is afraid he might have killed him, but Piccolo regenerates himself when Dabura is killed by Majin Buu and he reverts from his stone form, along with Krillin. With Gohan and Goku knocked out, Vegeta arrives to fight Majin Buu, only to be severely beaten by the monster. After saving Vegeta, Goten and Trunks attempt to fight alongside Vegeta, but he knocks the boys unconscious, knowing that Majin Buu is too strong for them to help him. He then blows himself up, hoping that will finish him, but fails, as Majin Buu regenerates. Goten is taken to The Lookout to take refuge from Majin Buu's assault on the world.<br><br>Later, the boys wake up and attack Mr. Popo on sight. Goku stops them and tells them that Vegeta and Gohan are dead, making the boys cry. Goten angrily blames Goku for Gohan's death (unaware that Gohan is actually alive) but is convinced to cooperate to defeat Majin Buu and avenge his brother. Goku teaches them the fusion technique with the remainder of time he has left on earth. Babidi tells the world that he is going to West City to blow it up. Trunks rushes to Capsule Corp to get the Dragon Radar. Goku intercepts Babidi and Buu to give Trunks time to get to Capsule Corp, Goku shows them Super Saiyan 3 and starts to fight Majin Buu. Trunks got the radar and Goku returned to the Lookout. Goku teaches the boys the Fusion Dance and shows them Super Saiyan 3. Fortuneteller Baba tells Goku his time is up (his time was shortened due to his Super Saiyan 3 transformation) and leaves the rest to Piccolo. Goten hugs his father one more time as he promises to take care of Chi-Chi before going back to Other World.<br><br>A day later, with Goku in Other World, Piccolo teaches the boys the rest of the Fusion Dance. After two days, Goten and Trunks are ready to fight Majin Buu. Goten then watches as Super Buu turns his mother into an egg and crushes her, angering Goten and thus prompting him to train as hard as he can after Piccolo informs Goten that they will bring his mother back to life with the Dragon Balls.<br><br>They fuse and create the warrior Gotenks, who fights Majin Buu twice, almost defeating him. However, Gotenks is absorbed by Super Buu along with Piccolo. Later, Goten is saved along with Piccolo, Trunks, and Gohan by Goku and a resurrected Vegeta. Goten dies along with Trunks, Gohan, Piccolo, and the other survivors when Kid Buu blows up the Earth, but he is brought back to life along with the others killed by Buu with the Namekian Dragon Balls. Goten, Trunks, Gohan, and Piccolo are then seen contributing to Goku's Super Spirit Bomb.<br><br>He meets with Goku once again, with everyone else on Kami's Lookout, after Goku had killed Kid Buu with the Super Spirit Bomb, and embraces him. He watches as his parents reunite and hug each other after Goku tells Chi-Chi he wants to live with her and their kids as a family of four now Goku has been brought back to life again by Old Kai.<br><br><h4>God of Destruction Beerus Saga</h4>
Some time has passed since the defeat of Kid Buu. Goten brings his father lunch while he is plowing a field and takes over for him by driving his tractor while his father eats, though Goten becomes distracted by Goku's training and drives off a cliff, getting saved by Goku. Goten and Trunks go out and went shopping for a gift for Videl, soon to be married with Gohan. After looking for rings, they go out to get Videl cosmetics. They were told by an old man to go to a hot spring and there the water would make your skin feel new.<br><br>They find the hot spring and encounter a giant snake. At one point, Goten was furious to the point he begins to use the Kamehameha, but Trunks told him not to because of the nearby old people were in the hot spring. The snake hits the jar with the water but Trunks eventually sends it slithering away. Goten and Trunks arrive at Gohan and Videl's new house to bring Videl her wedding present which she rubs on her face and thanks them for it even though she realizes that it is just regular spring water.<br><br>At the end of the day as the sun is setting, Goten comes back to the farm where Goku is working. Goten tells Goku about his day with Trunks and Goku is proud of them. Mr. Satan arrives and offers Goku 100 million Zeni for defeating Kid Buu. Goku starts to deny the money because of the vast amount of it until Goten reminds Goku that if he gave the money to Chi-Chi, he could go and freely train on King Kai's planet. After taking Goten's advice, Goku takes the money.<br><br>Goten is at Bulma's birthday party on the Princess Bulma cruise ship, with the others. When Beerus is enraged because Good Buu ate all of the pudding, he fights him, and blasts him into the ocean. Goten and Trunks fuse into Gotenks, to fight Beerus, but Gotenks is easily defeated. Later, Goten and Trunks both go Super Saiyan for the ritual to make Goku a Super Saiyan God, along with Vegeta, Gohan, and Videl (who was pregnant with Pan).<br><br>Goten and the others observe the fight between Goku and Beerus for a while from Bulma's ship, then in Bulma's ship. They couldn't fly on their own, because they were all out of ki from doing the Super Saiyan God ritual. After their battle, Beerus falls asleep in attempt to destroy Earth, so Whis takes him home. <br><br><h4>Golden Frieza Saga</h4>
After the fight with Goku and Beerus, Goten was first seen leaving after telling Chi-Chi he was going to hang out with Trunks. When Android 18 and Marron visit Goku's place to pick up Krillin, Goten plays ball with Marron and impresses her with his skills. Goten then arrives at Gohan's place with Goku when he finds out that Chi-Chi is planning on kicking out his brother and Mr. Satan for "rough playing" with Pan. He also arrives with his mom and brother when he told her that Goku was planning on going with Whis to train. Goten tried to convince her to let Goku go, but Chi-Chi told Goten to stay out of it.<br><br>Later, when Jaco arrives on Earth to warn Bulma of Frieza arriving on Earth for vengeance, he and Trunks come into contact into him when he is looking for Bulma. They then touch his skin and face to make sure they are not tights and a mask with Goten accidentally taking off one of the wireless radios on his ears. They then play around with his ship, where Jaco encourages them to play, which leads to them accidentally closing the hatch and crashing it into the pond, resulting in them being sent to their rooms as punishment.<br><br>Later on, while the Z-Fighters were fighting Frieza's forces, Goten and Trunks were playing ball outside when they sense Tagoma's ki and decided to join in the fight. After defusing as Gotenks, Goten and Trunks are frightened by Frieza's presence. They both run and hide along with Bulma and Jaco. Goten helps Bulma and Trunks summon Whis to bring Goku and Vegeta back to Earth. However, when Goku and Vegeta arrive, Goku sends Goten and Trunks to the Lookout to tell Dende what happened and additionally, the location is too dangerous for them.<br><br>He is killed when the planet explodes, but Whis uses his Temporal Do-Over to undo the damage, undoing Goten's death in the process. After killing Frieza, Goku tells Goten all about what happened while they were away at the Capsule Corporation and he later attends the party thrown by Bulma with his friends and family.<br><br><h4>Universe 6 Saga</h4>
Goten is present with his friends and family, cheering on the team of Universe 7 during the Tournament of Destroyers. Goten is also present as Beerus and Whis use the Super Dragon Balls to summon Super Shenron, then returns to Earth.<br><br><h4>Copy-Vegeta Saga</h4>
Goten attends the Universe 7 victory celebration with his friends and family, being told by Beerus to protect the fact that Monaka is weak as a secret from Goku. When Goku shows desperation to fight with Monaka, Goten suggests that Monaka could have the ability to "transform". Trunks then whispers something in Beerus' ear. While Goku was being distracted, Beerus dons the life-size Monaka costume created by Mr. Satan, and fights with Goku. Eventually, the battle is over, and the situation ends on a good note as Goku never realized that Monaka was an amateur and is even more motivated to train after fighting with him.<br><br>One day, Goten is eating dinner with his parents at home, when Goku shows signs of sadness and fatigue. Goten and Chi-Chi wonder if Goku is sick, or even dying. Eventually, Goku teleports to King Kai's planet, after a few attempts, and King Kai informs him of his Delayed Onset Ki Disorder. As Goku flies home, he unintentionally crashes into his house, destroying it and angering Chi-Chi, along with waking Goten, who was asleep. Goten accompanies his parents to Gohan and Videl's house, and he playfully spends time with his niece, Pan. When Pan disappears, Goten assists his parents and Piccolo with looking for her, flying around the house trying to find her. When Gohan and Videl return, Pan was already found, and Goten laughs with his family as Pan refers to Goku as "Gramps".<br><br>While Goten and Trunks are flying towards Capsule Corp, they notice Monaka's delivery truck, but finding out that Monaka is not present. Goten and Trunks then make their way inside the back of Monaka's truck, having fun with the items present in there. When they blow up a blow-up doll, the force calls the truck to bounce off the ground, closing the door and trapping them inside. Trunks prepares to blow the door open but does not want Monaka to get in trouble for having the truck damaged. They then wait for Monaka, who immediately climbs in his truck and flies off into space with the two boys still inside. On the way to Planet Potaufeu, Goten and Trunks are freezing in the truck due to being in outer space. Monaka then arrives to Potaufeu, and opens the back door, discovering Goten and Trunks frozen solid, and manages to thaw them. Potage, the planet's only inhabitant, appears and greets Monaka, and the intergalactic criminal Gryll confronts the group with his henchmen. Goten and Trunks realize Potage is in trouble, and easily defeat the henchmen, forcing them to retreat. They later reappear, holding the key to the seal of the "Superhuman Water". Goten and Trunks prepare to take the key back, but they remain still, realizing that Monaka has been taken hostage. Goten is tied up along with Trunks and Potage, as Gryll opens the seal to the Superhuman Water. Later, Goten and Trunks are being chased, while carrying Potage and Monaka, by Gryll and his henchmen, who are now purple. Goten can only watch as Trunks is knocked down, and is attacked again, however Vegeta and Jaco arrive and Vegeta deflects the attack.<br><br>Goten witnesses Vegeta easily defeating Gryll's henchmen, and being absorbed by the "Superhuman Water" and an exact copy of him is created. Goten later retreats carrying Monaka, along with Trunks, Potage, Jaco, and a drained Vegeta. In a secure spot, Potage explains the truth about the "Superhuman Water", which is actually a weapon named Commeson, and they learn that Duplicate Vegeta must be defeated in order to save Vegeta's life. Duplicate Vegeta later confronts the two, who then fuse into Gotenks and engages in battle with him. Even as a Super Saiyan 3, Gotenks cannot deal any damage to Duplicate Vegeta, and is defeated by a few blows. Fallen, Goten and Trunks are about to be finished off by Duplicate Vegeta, but they are saved by Goku's timely arrival. Goten tries to inform his father to defeat Duplicate Vegeta quickly, as he is an impostor.<br><br>Goten watches as Goku and Duplicate Vegeta fight, also showing surprise that Duplicate Vegeta can also transform into a Super Saiyan Blue. Goten accompanies Trunks, Potage and Jaco, as they try to save Vegeta by finding the Commeson's core. The core sneaks up behind Goten and tries to absorb him, but he is saved by Trunks and Jaco. The core then chases the group, as Goten flies behind Trunks, who panics and rushes to Vegeta's side, realizing his Ki is disappearing. Goten watches as the core is casually destroyed by Monaka, and Duplicate Vegeta is defeated by Goku. The group say goodbye to Potage and return to Earth, where Chi-Chi worriedly embraces Goten and asks if he is hurt.<br><br><h4>"Future" Trunks Saga</h4>
Goku, Piccolo, and Goten get ready to race to see who can harvest all of the crops first on Goku's field, but Chi-Chi scolds Goten and tells him to study for the test he has next week. Later, Goten and Chi-Chi tell Piccolo and Krillin that a Time Machine has appeared. Piccolo and Krillin leave to check it out and Goten follows them, but Chi-Chi grabs Goten and scolds him, telling him to study. Goten pleads to go, saying the Earth might be in trouble, but Chi-Chi refuses to listen, leaving Goten annoyed.<br><br>After that, Goten was awakened by Trunks to sneak into the Time Machine to help Goku and Vegeta to battle Goku Black but they were caught by Bulma. During this time his mother finds him, he is with the others when Bulma tells everyone about Goku Black and how Black in an alternate time killed Goten and Chi-Chi.<br><br>At the end, he sees the time machine return and embraces his father who was wounded in battle. He meets Future Trunks. After Black and Zamasu's defeat, he is seen with the others saying their goodbyes to Future Trunks' and Future Mai as they depart to the new future timeline.<br><br><h4>Universe Survival Saga</h4>
When Goku returns home, Goten asks if he is going out to train because he wants to as well. However, Chi-Chi intervenes and attempts to explain to Goten why training his brain is more important than fighting, but Goku and Goten sneak off while she is distracted. Goten travels with Goku as the latter picks up some bean daifuku from Whis, and then the two arrive at Capsule Corp. Once he finds out that Bulma is pregnant, Goten asks Trunks if he would prefer his sibling to be a boy or a girl. Goten wants to go with Goku to train with Whis, but Trunks tells him to train with him instead since he can't go far now that Bulma is pregnant. Goten agrees, and the two are seen sparring.<br><br>When Goku returns to Capsule Corp after learning the rules of the Tournament of Power, Goten is still fighting with Trunks. He says hi to his father, but is sucker punched by Trunks due to being distracted. Later on, Goten speaks with Vegeta about being excited for his new daughter. Embarrassed that Goten overheard him speaking on the matter Vegeta quickly leaves and says he is going to go train. Goten wants to train with Vegeta but he says no and is asked to help Trunks set up the baby room. Later, while Goku, Gohan, Supreme Kai and Hercule are discussing the tournament, Supreme Kai mentions Goten and Trunks as possible fighters mentioning their power at such a young age. Goku says no and mentions they would become a liability as they are too young and like to rush in head-first into every fight. When the baby is born, Goten tells Trunks he can train with a brother and a sister would be cute, but Trunks favors a brother. While Trunks is disappointed the baby is a girl, Goten remarks how cute she is and stays at Capsule Corp for a couple of days to help Trunks take care of Bulla.<br><br>Android 17 decides to participate in the Tournament of Power, so he tasks Goten and Trunks to protect the island he works on from poachers when the tournament begins. One day at Capsule Corp., Goten attempts to help Trunks change Bulla's diaper, and is shown to have more knowledge about changing diapers than Trunks, who ends up calling Vegeta for help. Vegeta effortlessly changes the diaper and Goten and Trunks are amazed. Less than an hour before the tournament begins, Goten arrives at 17's island with Trunks, Krillin, 18, and Marron. The boys quickly explore the island and let Marron stay with them, as 18 tells Krillin that Marron is tougher than he thinks.<br><br>Goten reappears during the final moments of the saga, revealing Trunks and himself lived up to their end of the deal and protected 17's island, only suffering minor injuries from their ordeal. Later he attends the celebration for Bulla's birth held at Capsule Corp. Goten and Trunks are presumably trusted to watch 17's island again as 17 takes his family on a cruise. </div>

<p>
The Superhero Database Classification number, or SHDB Class, is a number that represents the overall 'power' of a character. All traits of a character are used for calculating the Classification.
</p>
<h5>What it DOESN'T mean</h5>
<p>
This doesn't mean that a higher class would always beat a lower class character. But the bigger the difference in Class is, the more obvious it is who'll win in a fight.
</p>
<h5>How is this calculated</h5>
<pre class="footnote">( INT^1.3 + (STR*0.5 )^2 + (SPE*0.5)^2 + DUR^1.6 + (POW + (SPS*SPL))^2 + COM^1.8 ) ^ TIER</pre>
<h6>Super Power Score and Level</h6>
<p>Every Super Power has a score (SPS) that is used to calculate the Class. Each Super Power also has 3 levels (SPL). The level is set when connecting that Super Power to a character. The level determines the final score, of the Super Power, being used in the calculation.
