<h3>Jaco's History</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
Not much is known about Jaco's past, except that it is mentioned that he once used the Extinction Bomb and destroyed some people, though he got harsh scolding from his seniors.<br><br><h4>Jaco the Galactic Patrolman</h4>
Jaco was sent to Earth by the Galactic King to prevent a Saiyan threat that was detected heading there.<br><br>Jaco is first seen in his spaceship flying to Earth, when he crashes on the Moon and is hurled towards Earth. He is later seen propelling his boat and carrying him on the dock. He asks Omori who he is, just what he wanted to ask. Omori notes how lucky the former is for having escaped the Monster Shark. Then he asks who Jaco is, and Jaco responds that he is an alien. At first, Omori expresses doubt, and Jaco calls himself a "Galactic Patrolman". Omori offers to fix his damaged spaceship, and when he can't figure out the mechanics of the spaceship, he squeezes Jaco's cheeks to confirm that he is an alien. Jaco reveals that he was on patrol when he got distracted by a video and smashed onto the Moon, and hit Earth. Omori says he would work on the spaceship in the morning, and invites Jaco to his house.<br><br>At the house, Jaco calls it "primitive lodging", probably because on his planet, things are much more advanced. When Omori offers him food, Jaco says that he can only have milk and cheese, as it is the closest to what he eats at his planets. He reveals that the planet has sent probes to Earth, such as robotic flies. He also reveals that he had all the languages of the galaxy inputted in his brain, except he skipped the lesson about fixing the spaceship. Omori inquires whether Jaco's planet has a time machine, and Jaco replies no, saying that it's forbidden by the Galactic laws. Omori and Jaco both go to sleep, except Jaco only needed 30 minutes of it. He then goes for a swim, and then Jaco kills Monster Shark when it attacks Jaco. When Omori wakes up, he's impressed by how Jaco killed the shark, and Jaco reveals that Omori is now in his debt. They begin talking about a popular idol was going to go into space without any training to earn money. Before Omori goes to fix the ship. Jaco asks what the collapsed building to the right was, and Omori reveals his tragic past - it was a research lab until an incident occurred killing many people. Jaco notes that he was lucky they never succeeded, and Omori notes that there are too many bad people on the Earth. When Omori expresses doubt about being able to fix the spaceship, Jaco expresses disappointment in humans. He reveals his true mission - to save humans from a fearsome alien on a projectile coming in three days at 10:00 AM. Omori expresses contempt about humans, Jaco offers to use an Extinction Bomb to wipe out humanity from Earth. Omori instructs Jaco to never use it, and Jaco says that he will observe humans longer, but he may if he's annoyed. Jaco reveals that he once pressed the button on the bomb and killed people, but he got harsh scolding from the seniors.<br><br>In order to get some supplies, Jaco and Omori decide to leave the island for East City, where they meet a girl named Tights. Tights is being attacked by four muggers when Jaco saves her. She figures out that Jaco is an alien when he talks about the "Earth Police" and Omori tries to pass him off as a "foreigner from another country", but she says there are not any foreigners like him. Omori notes that Tights sounds like a name from the western region; Tights is from West City. When they remark the police are after them, the trio takes refuge on top of a building. The police are searching for Jaco after he beat up two of them and are calling him the "Mask Man"; they say the location where Jaco saved Tights is "Capital Ward 32", and the event happened at 8pm. Tights forces her way back to Omori's island by telling them that she might rat them out if they make her stay behind, so the trio leave the city and return to Omori's island thanks to Jaco's ability to fly via his boots, which can only be used in case of emergencies. At Omori's island, Tights reveals she is the one who will be on the rocket instead of the idol Ann Azuki, as it would be bad publicity if they lost their "super idol" in a launch mishap after all. This way, they can perform a "miraculous rescue" if the people in the rocket are killed. The money she used to buy the Sky Gold was her compensation for taking on the job. Meanwhile, Katayude is shown at home. As he is watching TV, Katayude sees Jaco on the news, remembering he saw him on Omori's island.<br><br>Tights leaves the island to be on the rocket and, a short time later, Katayude arrives with four soldiers to get Jaco. Jaco defeats the soldiers, and he and Omori use his spaceship to rescue Tights and the pilot from the crashing rocket. After kicking the rocket away from the city it was about to crash on, Jaco destroys the rocket with his Ray Gun. As they witnessed the whole scene, Katayude and the soldiers decide to let Jaco and Omori live in peace and leave the island. In the last chapter it is later revealed that the alien invader Jaco has come to defeat is a Saiyan. It is later revealed that the Saiyan that Jaco was looking for is Kakarot and he ended up at Grandpa Gohan's house, eating up a ton of food with the elderly martial artist Son Gohan giving Kakarot his Earthling name Son Goku as as the young Kakarot hadn't yet learned how to speak. Jaco was distracted and did not notice Kakarot's Attack Ball landing on Earth, so he thought the Saiyan just did not show up. Unbeknownst to Jaco or the Galactic Patrol, his parents Gine and Bardock had sent Kakarot to Earth in a stolen Attack Ball to save his life due to Bardock's fears Frieza's was planning to exterminate the Saiyan race, thus Kakarot's departure from Planet Vegeta was unauthorized and he was not actually sent to conquer Earth as Bardock selected it as it was far outside of Frieza's empire and its inhabitants were weak thus would pose no threat to his son despite Kakarot being a low class Saiyan.<br><br>While still on Omori's island, Tights is soon visited by her family on Omori's island, as her father Dr. Brief knew Omori by reputation for his work in space-time research. While meeting the Briefs, Jaco encounters Bulma who tests a powerful laser beam she planned to use on Jaco after hearing that there was an alien the island. While playing around, the five-year-old Bulma repairs Jaco's ship; As thanks for fixing his ship he offers them use of his gravity stabilizer which allows his ship to fly.<br><br>Ten years after parting ways, Omori, Jaco, Tights and Katayude reunite on the former's island for a temporary reunion. Omori is given plastic model of Z'Gok as a gift, which can be seen on top of his tractor at one point. During the reunion, it is revealed that in the intervening years, Tights forced Jaco to take her to visit a few planets before their ten-year reunion. Since then, Jaco got a girlfriend and Tights has become a talented Science Fiction writer, though her first novel Space Police Chako, based on Jaco the Galactic Patrolman, was a dud. Omori has just finished narrating how Tights' sister Bulma visited his island with her parents and met Jaco ten years ago and now, ten years after their first meeting, Bulma visits Omori again. Being a super-genius, Bulma has already graduated from university and has set out on a trip. She says something about looking for mysterious orbs that grant any wish when brought together. She shows off two, which are made of a substance that does not exist on Earth, so she reasoned they came from outer space. It all sounds quite suspicious, but space is vast, so perhaps this sort of mysterious orb exists out there somewhere. Omori notes that he will ask Jaco about it next time he stops by. While Jaco returns home after the meeting, Bulma is shown using her Dragon Radar and Goku is shown dragging his catch back to the house as in the first Dragon Ball chapter.<br><br><h4>Golden Frieza Saga</h4>
Four months after Frieza decides to train to exact his revenge on Goku, Jaco heads to Earth to warn Bulma about the upcoming threat when he comes into contact with Goten and Trunks. He becomes surprised when he realizes Bulma has become a mother and becomes frustrated when the boys tease him for his appearance before introducing himself to them. The boys eventually bring Bulma to him so he can warn her about Frieza's comeback. He was shocked when she told him about Trunks defeating Frieza, but that it was her son's future counterpart who defeated Frieza before the present Trunks was born. Jaco informs her that time traveling is a serious crime punishable by losing their planet but Bulma claims to have never heard such a law. Jaco asks how an Earthling could defeat Frieza, and Bulma explains the boys are half-Saiyans and that her husband is a Saiyan, and that he and Goku are training on Beerus' Planet. Jaco disregards Beerus as myth but is worried he will get in trouble for unknowingly allowing Saiyans to reside on Earth as it was his job to prevent that but says no one remembers that anyway. Jaco eventually tells Bulma about Frieza's resurrection and he plans to leave immediately. However, Trunks and Goten accidentally fly his ship into a lake while playing with it. Jaco then tells Bulma that Frieza will arrive in an hour and she berates him for not telling her earlier.<br><br>Jaco escorts Bulma to North City where the Dragon Team and Frieza are. He plans to leave but stays because Bulma orders him to stay, saying he's an elite galactic patrolman who is supposed to protect the Earth. Jaco helps Gohan, Piccolo, Master Roshi, Krillin, and Tien Shinhan to a minimum while still combating some of Frieza's soldiers. Jaco says that Tagoma is beatable due to it being 5-on-one, excluding himself. When Goten and Trunks arrive and wonders what the Ginyu Force is, Jaco explains to them that the Ginyu Force is a group of elite soldiers under Frieza. Jaco attempts to flee again as the Z Fighters are left defeated when Piccolo is killed but Bulma chokeholds him to stop him. Goku and Vegeta finally show up, and Jaco notes how scary Vegeta is as her husband and wonders what their intimate life is like, much to Bulma's fury.<br><br>Goku battles Frieza as Jaco realizes Goku is the one who defeated Frieza on Namek but is shocked to learn Vegeta is the Saiyan Prince. Jaco tries to flee out of fear of getting killed and begs Bulma to let him go but she refuses. Frieza launches an attack on Jaco and Bulma but Vegeta saves them and Jaco's ship catches on fire and he is dismayed that the only picture of his girlfriend is ruined. When Goku transforms into Super Saiyan Blue for the first time, Jaco takes pictures for his report on why the Earth should be destroyed but Bulma destroys his camera. He then meets Beerus for the first time, shocked to see the God of Destruction was real and with Bulma hides next to him for safety after Frieza expresses fear of the god's presence. Jaco soon asks Bulma to take a picture of him with the God of Destruction. Bulma tells him to ask Beerus himself and be wary in case Beerus destroys him, causing him to recant his request. When Frieza is defeated by Vegeta and blows up the Earth, Jaco survives the explosion with Bulma, Goku, Gohan, Krillin, Master Roshi, and Tien thanks to Beerus and Whis, but Whis reverses time to give Goku another change to kill Frieza and prevent Earth's demise.<br><br>Bulma later asks Jaco if he is going to report everything that happened and arrest Whis or Beerus since time traveling is a serious crime. Jaco, afraid of Beerus, says he will pretend he saw nothing.<br><br><h4>Universe 6 Saga</h4>
Jaco is on a planet building rocks when he gets a call from Tights and is told to go to Earth to see Bulma. Jaco refuses because he doesn't want to deal with her but changes his mind when Bulma threatens to send Vegeta to destroy the Galactic Patrol Headquarters. When reaching Earth, Jaco is mad that Bulma is calling him for the smallest things. When Bulma asks him to take her to the center of the universe to find the last Super Dragon Ball, Jaco reveals that the universe has many galaxies, instead of four. He suggests that she goes a see a mysterious one named Zuno who knows everything. Bulma insists that he took her to see him. Jaco agrees to take her to see him. Vegeta orders him to not do anything "suspicious" with Bulma, which makes Jaco chuckle and Bulma hits him over the head.<br><br>On the way to Zuno's Planet, Jaco is informed of the existence of more universes and the Super Dragon Balls, which he had no knowledge of, even as an elite soldier of the Galactic Patrol. Jaco is interested in spectating the universe tournament and it was a suggestion by Bulma to bring his girlfriend. She however dumped him, using an old-fashion line.<br><br>When they arrive, they are stopped by one of Zuno's attendants. One of his attendants tells them that Zuno isn't taking non-appointed guests and would have to wait seven years for an appointment. However, Zuno's next guest is Geppuman, a dine and dasher wanted by the Galactic Patrol. At first Jaco does nothing, as he blamed Geppuman for destroying a monument that he destroyed himself, and bringing him in could mean that the Patrol will figure out the it was Jaco who destroyed it. Right before Geppuman goes to Zuno, Jaco tells him to freeze. Geppuman then pulls out a Ray Gun, and takes one of Zuno's attendants hostage. Jaco then puts his thumb out. Geppuman asks what he's doing, and Jaco replies that he's calculating the distance between them to see if Jaco can attack Geppuman before he can pull the trigger. Jaco says it's close, but he'll be able to pull it off. Geppuman then panics, and points his ray gun at Jaco. Before he can fire however, Jaco quickly attacks him, incapacitates him, and arrests him, thereby freeing up a slot for them to visit. They visit Zuno in his room. Jaco has to present a gift for Zuno to ask him questions. Jaco wants to give him a kiss but Zuno obliges and only give him one question for being a male. Jaco uses the question to ask Zuno about Bulma's bust size, which is 83.4 centimeters after breast feeding. Bulma is given three questions because she is a woman but middle-aged. She uses two of her questions by mistake but manages to get one question about the origin of the Super Dragon Balls. Jaco gets mad at Bulma for wasting two questions and they are both forced to leave but can come back a year later for more questions.<br><br>Five days later, Jaco attends the Tournament of Destroyers with the Galactic King. On the way to the Nameless Planet, when the Galactic King is upset that no one is giving him attention, Jaco explains to the Galactic King that they have met beings over the King like the Kais and the Gods of Destruction. The eventually arrive on the star, after playing a game of Shiritori. Jaco is a bystander for this tournament so he sits with Universe 7's guests. After the referee introduces the singer and he sings the universe anthem, the first match is between Goku and Botamo. Goku beats Botamo by pushing his down and throwing him out of the ring because he couldn't do any damage to him, resulting in a ring-out. Goku immediately is next challenged by Frost. While Goku and Frost are fighting, Jaco notices something happen when Frost connects a punch to Goku, resulting in Goku getting drowsy and losing his match against Frost. As Frost was about to be announced to be the winner against his match with Piccolo, Jaco noticed something was wrong and suggested to the referee that Frost was using poison to win his matches. Following Jaco's advice the referee checked Frost's body and discovered the needle concealed in his right arm much to everyone's surprise, including Champa and Cabba.<br><br>Later on, when Vegeta was defeated by Hit, Goku approaches Jaco and asks him if he can see his movements, and Jaco replies that he cannot. The Galactic King realizes that Hit is using the Time-Skip technique, which Jaco recognizes. Goku asks Jaco if he is going to arrest Hit for manipulating time, as that is a Galactic violation, but Jaco, concerned for his own safety, says he will overlook it. He then spectates Goku and Hit's match, and the arrival of Zeno.<br><br><h4>Copy-Vegeta Saga</h4>
Jaco attends the Universe 7 victory party thrown by Bulma on Earth. Jaco has ordered some special snacks that Monaka has delivered, leading Bulma to realize that Beerus and Whis did not invite Monaka to the party despite her telling them to. Jaco then finds out Monaka's secret and is tasked to assist protecting it from Goku. Jaco then witnesses Goku's battle with "Monaka" (Beerus in a Monaka costume), and then the party commences.<br><br>When Goten and Trunks stowed away on Monaka's delivery truck and end up on Potaufeu, Jaco is asked by Bulma to go retrieve them. Jaco refuses, stating he has other matters to attend to, such as capturing the intergalactic criminal Gryll (not aware that he is currently on Potaufeu). Bulma then blackmails Jaco, using the picture of the Galactic King with a drawn-on mustache that Bulma saw in Jaco's spaceship. Jaco then finally agrees to retrieving the two boys, and Bulma makes Vegeta accompany Jaco on the trip. On the way to Potaufeu, Jaco is listening to a universal radio station, intimidated by Vegeta.<br><br>Having arrived on Planet Potaufeu, Jaco is surprised to see that Gryll, his target, is there. He witnesses Vegeta being absorbed by Commeson and his copy emerging. As Duplicate Vegeta tries to absorb Trunks, Jaco saves him by shooting at Duplicate Vegeta's tentacles with his Galactic Patrol gun, striking a pose. As he is posing, he realizes that the others have escaped, and narrowly escapes on his own after Duplicate Vegeta and Duplicate Gryll try to absorb him.<br><br>Later, as he explains that the "Superhuman Water" can increase the drinker's strength a hundred-fold, Potage, Potaufeu's only inhabitant, announces that Commeson is actually a weapon, and the whole "Superhuman Water" idea were false rumors created by non-inhabitants, much to Jaco's surprise. Jaco later witnesses Copy-Vegeta's fight with Gotenks, being the first to point out that Vegeta's body was growing transparent due to Commeson's effects.<br><br>When Trunks and Goten attempt to destroy the core inside the Commeson when Vegeta's body has begun to fade away, Jaco follows them thinking it to be safer than standing in the nearby vicinity of Goku and Duplicate Vegeta's battle. As the Commenson chases them, it serves around the fallen Jaco finding him to be too weak to even bother absorbing, much to his annoyance.<br><br><h4>"Future" Trunks Saga</h4>
Jaco is at a space ramen stand waiting to eat. However, he is distracted when a dangerous parasitic criminal named Watagash that he had captured earlier escapes his spaceship. Jaco manages to follow him to Earth, where he comes across Gohan dressed as the Great Saiyaman flying with a pop idol named Cocoa. Jaco mistakenly believes that the Great Saiyaman was infected by Watagash and threatens to use his spaceship's energy cannon.<br><br>However, he stops when the latter reveals his identity as Gohan who Jaco is surprised to see with a cute woman. He reveals he is looking for a criminal named Watagash and if he helps then he won't reveal that Gohan was with another woman to the latter's dismay.<br><br><h4>Universe Survival Saga</h4>
Jaco appears after Goku and Android 17 have captured the Galactic Poachers, who have taken the Minotaurus, to take them into custody and thanks Goku and 17 for their efforts, saying that he will take the credit despite not being there. He then flies off with the poachers' spaceship attached to the back of his own. Jaco later attends the celebration party for Bulla's birth and the victory of Universe 7 in the Tournament of Power.<br><br><h4>Galactic Patrol Prisoner Saga</h4>
Jaco wakes Goku up after he is knocked out and brought over to the Galactic Patrol Headquarters though is unsure why he and Vegeta are there seeing as they only needed Buu. When the two are inducted temporarily into the Galactic Patrol, Jaco presents them with their official uniforms and tries to teach them their victory pose though they turn it down. Talking with Merus and Jaco prior to joining the Galactic Patrol, Goku and Vegeta revealed how not long before the Moro situation, they had encountered a Saiyan named Broly and had been forced to fuse into Gogeta to defeat him.<br><br>Jaco goes with Goku, Vegeta and fellow teammates Merus and Irico to the planet Jung to apprehend the Macareni trio. After completing their mission, Goku and Vegeta next head to New Namek with Jaco not being aware that the Namekians still existed after Frieza destroyed their original home planet. Jaco, Merus and Irico meanwhile return to the Headquarters to retrieve Buu. While there, Jaco receives a call from Bulma asking where her husband has been and when she demands that a ship be sent over to her so she can head over to Headquarters herself, Jaco hangs up on her.<br><br>The three members of the Galactic Patrol now along with Buu head to New Namek and Jaco tells Goku and Vegeta that Buu has had his old memories returned to him. As Buu battles Moro, Jaco is amazed to see how strong he is as well as the weird moves that he pulls off. When Moro regains his powers and begins to absorb up all of the planets energy, Jaco boards the spaceship and later comes back to assist his allies Goku and Vegeta during their battle against the escaped convicts, taking them down with their weapons. Goku then grabs a hold of everyone minus Vegeta and uses his Instant Transmission to return everyone to Headquarters. When Goku asks to test Merus' strength, Jaco misunderstands the situation and thinks they are on bad terms but then realizes while watching the two fight that they are merely sparring.<br><br>A few days later, the Galactic King suggests finding some more special members for the Galactic King and reminds Jaco of Piccolo. Sometime later, Bulma, with Dende and Mr. Satan also nearby, contact Jaco and he explains to them the situation regarding Moro. He tells them that he is heading to Earth to ask Piccolo for help and also for Bulma to gather up Gohan, Krillin and Tien Shinhan. When he arrives he is unhappy to see that only Piccolo and Krillin are there. Upon seeing the Macareni Gang locked up nearby, he goes over to taunt them but to his horror finds out that they have already contacted Moro. He contacts HQ who inform him that Seven-Three, Shimorekka and Yunba are heading their way and Jaco attempts to leave the planet only to be stopped by Bulma. Jaco tells everyone about Seven-Three and his ability and just as he finishes, the three appear through a warp portal with Seven-Three stealing Piccolo's ability and punching Jaco off of the Lookout. Jaco saves himself from a fatal fall by using his jet boosters and while Piccolo battles Seven-Three, Jaco goes up against Shimorekka.<br><br>Jaco watches when Gohan faces off against Seven-Three and urges him to launch his Kamehameha against him even after Piccolo's abilities have wore off. After Seven-Three switches to using Moro's abilities, Jaco joins the others in trying to stop him but instead has his energy absorbed leaving him helpless and beaten. When Moro's men are ordered to return, Jaco is able to buy Earth two months time by telling Shimorekka that Goku and Vegeta will not return so quickly because of the planets primitive technology.<br><br>Two months later, Jaco, along with several other members of the Galactic Patrol, head to Earth in preparation for Moro's impending assault. There, they join Gohan, Piccolo, Krillin, Tien Shinhan, Yamcha, Chiaotzu and Master Roshi. Krillin asks Jaco about the current location of Goku and Vegeta. Jaco tells him that he has sent a heads-up to Goku, but has no idea where Vegeta is, though he is sure that both will show up eventually. After the Galactic Bandit Brigade appear and scatter around Earth to steal the planets treasures, the Dragon Team split up to confront them. Jaco stays with Gohan and Piccolo however while they battle against Seven-Three for the second time and commends them on their teamwork when they appear to outmatch him.<br><br>When Moro arrives on the battlefield, Gohan notes how horrifying his ki feels and Jaco explains that it is from having stolen energy from everyone he had killed. When Saganbo appears besides Moro, he asks if he can take them and Moro empowers him with his energy. Jaco joins the others in trying to put a halt to their enemy but they are all overpowered. Jaco calls Saganbo out for having no pride and taking orders from Moro like a lapdog. Saganbo explains to him that Moro had freed them and gave them power so that they will never get captured again but Jaco finds that what he is doing now is even more pathetic than being locked up in prison. When Goku arrives and starts attacking Saganbo in his Ultra Instinct Sign form, Jaco and Moro are the only two who can see his movements because of his advanced eyesight.<br><br>After Vegeta arrives on the battlefield, he beats Moro down thoroughly to a point he only has a shred of energy left. Turning to Jaco, Vegeta asks if he wants Moro to be captured or killed. Jaco confirms the latter, as the only reason Moro was still alive to begin with was because nobody was able to execute him in the past.<br><br>As the battle continues and the Z fighters are taken down, Jaco is seen with Piccolo being sent flying into rocks. After the Androids are defeated and Piccolo is taken down by Moro's own special beam canon, Jaco is the only man left standing. Deeming Jaco not a suitable meal, Moro decides to simply kill him as he sees no use in him. Jaco, despite being utterly terrified, decides he'd rather die fighting and shoots Moro. Moro however, blocks as another bullet comes for him. Jaco is confused, wondering how his bullet managed to do that, only for it to later be revealed that Merus arrived, saving him in the process.<br><br>While Merus faces Moro, Jaco is surprised to learn of his true strength and even more surprised to learn that he is actually an Angel. He later watches as Merus fades away due to having broken his code. </div>

<p>
The Superhero Database Classification number, or SHDB Class, is a number that represents the overall 'power' of a character. All traits of a character are used for calculating the Classification.
</p>
<h5>What it DOESN'T mean</h5>
<p>
This doesn't mean that a higher class would always beat a lower class character. But the bigger the difference in Class is, the more obvious it is who'll win in a fight.
</p>
<h5>How is this calculated</h5>
<pre class="footnote">( INT^1.3 + (STR*0.5 )^2 + (SPE*0.5)^2 + DUR^1.6 + (POW + (SPS*SPL))^2 + COM^1.8 ) ^ TIER</pre>
<h6>Super Power Score and Level</h6>
<p>Every Super Power has a score (SPS) that is used to calculate the Class. Each Super Power also has 3 levels (SPL). The level is set when connecting that Super Power to a character. The level determines the final score, of the Super Power, being used in the calculation.
