<h3>Xeno Trunks's History</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
Xeno Trunks went through a near identical life to Future Trunks - albeit he traveled back in time to the world the Xeno incarnations of the Dragon Team inhabited. He notably lived through the Android Saga exactly as his counterpart did.[6]<br><br><h4>Dark Demon Realm Saga</h4>
In the manga, shortly after his death at the conclusion of the Cell Games, Future Trunks was revived by the Dragon Balls and headed back to his future, where he restored peace by destroying the evil Future Androids, and then Future Cell three years later. However, soon after, Future Trunks found himself in the Time Nest. Startled, he soon received another surprise as Chronoa appeared and attacked him, he managed to evade her and she explained that his usage of a Time Machine was against the law. After explaining that Towa and Mira were causing trouble, the Supreme Kai of Time decides that Future Trunks can serve as a member of the Time Patrol, and gifts him with his "Xeno Trunks" clothes.<br><br>Chronoa and Xeno Trunks head to confront Towa and Mira in their hideout, but Mira quickly attacks with an energy blast, terrifying the Kai. Xeno Trunks manages to deflect it with his sword, however Mira sends the Masked Saiyan to combat him, finding himself overwhelmed in his base form by the Masked Saiyan, Xeno Trunks ascends to Super Saiyan and is able to fight on even grounds with him, eventually managing to land a blow that cracks his mask.<br><br>Mira is enraged by this and transforms into Super Mira, however before Mira can overwhelm Xeno Trunks, he is hit with an energy wave from behind by the Masked Saiyan, whose mask crumbles - revealing his identity as Bardock. Xeno Trunks teams up with Bardock to fight Super Mira, and are able to fight on even grounds with him and eventually overwhelm him. However Towa teleports herself and Mira away before the battle can conclude. After a brief conversation with Bardock, Xeno Trunks heads back to the Time Nest. Chronoa explains the Demon Realm to Xeno Trunks, when Demigra unexpectedly appears.<br><br>After a brief conversation, Xeno Trunks prepares to fight after Demigra notices Tokitoki. Demigra then abruptly leaves. Xeno Trunks wants to pursue him, but Chronoa says that it would be too much for him, and summons the strongest warrior from Xeno Trunks' memories - Xeno Goku - to aid him for a limited time.<br><br><h4>Dark Empire Saga</h4>
Discovering that the Battle of Namek's time has been corrupted, Xeno Trunks travels back to that time with Xeno Goku to fix the issue. Finding that Xeno Frieza has been empowered by the One-Star Dark Dragon Ball, the two aid Super Saiyan Goku (Namek) and when Xeno Frieza is distracted by their combined Kamehameha. Xeno Trunks cuts him in half in the same manner as Xeno Frieza's Death Saucer did in the proper time.<br><br>When Demon God Towa shows up to take the Dark Dragon Ball, Xeno Trunks attacks with a Kamehameha, Mira gets in the way of the attack and is vaporized, allowing Towa to escape with the Dark Dragon Ball.<br><br>Soon after the ordeal with Demon God Towa, Chronoa detects two changes in history. Because of this Chronoa decides to split up, Xeno Goku and Chronoa will go together while Xeno Trunks teams up with a new recruit, Xeno Vegeta. They then head off to the altered history, turning out to be taking place in the Cell Games, with most of the Dragon Team defeated with a newly emerged Xeno Cell fused with a Dark Dragon Ball. Xeno Vegeta soon springs into action, defeating Xeno Cell and blowing most of his body off with a Final Flash. However, before he finishes him off, Demon God Gravy arrives and knocks Xeno Vegeta out. Xeno Trunks tries to battle Gravy but is sent back as well. Having no other option, Xeno Trunks fuses with the unconscious Xeno Vegeta into Xeno Vegeks.<br><br>However, this fusion was unsuccessful against Gravy, Putine and later Cell-X and ultimately defused. But before Gravy could deal the final blow, Chronoa teleports them to her location in order to help against Xeno Majin Buu and the Dark Empire Forces.<br><br>When Xeno Trunks and Xeno Vegeta were transported via Chronoa's magic to her location. Xeno Trunks immediately saves Xeno Goku from a newly transformed Demon God Xeno Majin Buu. As a Super Saiyan he holds him off until Xeno Goku and Xeno Vegeta fuse into Xeno Vegito. During the fight between Demon God Xeno Majin Buu and Xeno Vegito, a mysterious individual suddenly arrives and interferes with the fight, saving Xeno Majin Buu. Before any of the Time Patrol could react, Demon God Xeno Majin Buu used this time to escape. Back at the Sacred World of the Kai, the individual appears once more. Xeno Trunks attempts to attack the demon but is stopped by Chronoa, to question him. The demon says that he means no harm, and warns them that Hell is becoming more and more agitated.<br><br>Though disagreeing at first, the Time Patrol agree to help Chamel by sending Xeno Goku and Xeno Vegeta. Chronoa then transfers all of their injuries onto herself and rests, with Xeno Trunks guarding her while Chamel, Xeno Goku, and Xeno Vegeta, leave to travel to Hell. Xeno Trunks and Xeno Gohan travel to another change in history, meeting Towa, Salsa, and a Dark Dragon Ball merged Xeno Lord Slug. Towa forcefully evolves Xeno Lord Slug into his Dark Evolution, a Super Giant-Form. Immediately being overwhelmed by Xeno Lord Slug's might, Xeno Gohan and Xeno Trunks use the fusion dance to fuse into Xeno Gohanks. However, in their fused form they are unable to do any damage to Xeno Lord Slug due to his overwhelming size.<br><br>Xeno Trunks appears with the rest of the Time Patrol in the Demon Realm just as Mechikabura is summoning Dark Shenron in order to regain his youth. Mechikabura's subordinates, Gravy, Putine, Towa, Salsa, Mira, Xeno Dabura show up in order to hold off the Time Patrol to buy time for the Dragon to restore their masters power. As the battles between the Time Breakers and Time Patrol unfolds, Xeno Trunks heads off along with Chronoa as back up and transforms into a Super Saiyan 3 to dispose of the enemy forces. However, he is struck by Dark Shenron's tail and soon after they are all transported back to the Time Nest except for Chronoa.<br><br><h4>Dark King Mechikabura Saga</h4>
Xeno Goku and the other members of the Time Patrol are thanked for their work in preserving the timelines by Old Kai when Xeno Trunks notices another disturbance. The Time Patrol head to Age 790 where they witness Gogeta fighting against Omega Shenron. Soon after arriving, their present timeline counterparts, friends and family under a form of mind control attack them. Xeno Trunks ends up fighting against his counterpart self until he notices Towa along with her brother Dabura nearby and demands to know how they got free and whether Chronoa is alright of which he is assured that she is. When Demigra, Chamel and Robelu show up, Xeno Trunks asks Chamel if he is really sided with Demigra and he is told to just draw his own conclusions from observation. Xeno Trunks wonders what Demigra's motives are and if he plans to to unseat Chronoa's position, though Demigra simply expresses that it is convenient to make use of them. Eventually everyone is frozen in place and Xeno Trunks recalls such an ability just as he see's a mind controlled Chronoa hovering above them. In the end, he along with everyone else is teleported away to Demigra's lair by Robelu's magic.<br><br>The Time Patrol are told by Chamel of the six Hell Gates and that behind each one lies a Demon God who is maintaining a barrier to Mechikabura's Palace and they must all be defeated. Robelu uses her magic to transform Trunks' sword into a Key Sword and instructs him to stay behind to use the key to cut off the barriers power as well as slightly weakening the Demon Gods inside each gate.<br><br>After everyone succeeds in their mission and returns to the hideout, Xeno Trunks soon notices when everyone freezes in place and turns to see Chronoa floating above. Chronoa realizes that Xeno Trunks was not frozen due to him wielding the Key Sword and vows to release more of her power. Entering into her Time Power Unleashed form, Chronoa uses the Time Clock technique, sending a barrage of dark arrows that impale Xeno Trunks. Xeno Trunks while holding the Key views segments of Chronoa's memories as she is defeated by Towa and brainwashed by Mechikabura. Furious, he transforms into a Super Saiyan 3 and charges at Chronoa. Striking her with the Key Sword, he purifies the darkness within her and returns her to normal along with unfreezing the rest in the hideout. Chronoa apologizes for everything that she has done though Xeno Trunks tells her that she has nothing to be sorry about.<br><br>Just then a mass of dark energy comes crashing down upon everyone as Mechikabura emerges a top a nearby tower. Xeno Trunks is the only one left standing which he believes is down to wielding the Key Sword. Xeno Trunks charges in and attacks Mechikabura with his Key Sword only for him to stop it with his fingertip with ease. Xeno Trunks is easily beaten and the sword is taken from him and promptly thrown away. After Mechikabura summons the other Demon Gods and absorbs them to enter into his Time Unleashed, he heads off to the Time Nest. Chronoa asks Xeno Trunks to go after him but before he heads off, the defeated Saiyans give their remaining energy to him which unexpectedly transforms him into a Super Saiyan God. Xeno Trunks and Chronoa appear at the Time Nest where he attacks Mechikabura with his own sword. Mechikabura is impressed by Xeno Trunks' new found power, however before the battle can truly begin Fin - now in his Ultimate Evolution form - arrives to battle Xeno Trunks along with Towa who watches from nearby.<br><br>Fin launches a volley of blasts which Xeno Trunks has to block to protect the two Supreme Kai, Chronoa uses Freeze to halt the blasts, allowing Xeno Trunks to fight Fin - to which he quickly defeats the artificial Majin after kicking him hard to the ground. Xeno Trunks then charges Mechikabura, but Mechikabura teleports Towa in front of him to use as a shield and Xeno Trunks' sword penetrates her. Mechikabura then forms a black hole which begins to absorb everything around it, including Towa, Xeno Trunks' sword and some of the Time Nest.<br><br>Trapped, Chronoa explains that Mechikabura has begun to absorb time itself and soon the universe will be ruined. Urgent to find a way out, they suddenly find several chains latch on to them before being yanked out of the dark void thanks to Demigra. Demigra asks where the Key Sword is but Chronoa explains that Mechikabura had obtained it and threw it away. Nevertheless, Xeno Trunks charges in with his own sword with Demigra backing him up and slashes Mechikabura across the chest. However now capable of instant regeneration, Mechikabura heals his wound. Just then the other members of the Time Patrol and Demigra Army arrive through a rift with Xeno Goku in possession of the Key Sword.<br><br>Chronoa has them buy her some time so that she can recharge the sword and upon doing so, Xeno Trunks takes it up once more. Demigra yanks Mechikabura forward with his chains and Xeno Trunks lands another strike. However this time a large seal baring Chronoa's crest appears across Mechickabura's chest. Xeno Trunks and the others have combined all four of the power of the gods, the power of darkness, the power of light, and the power of time in order to seal Mechickabura away. Xeno Trunks strikes at him one more time, sealing him away in an "Eternal Labyrinth" while Mechikabura screams out, vowing that he will find a way to escape. After Tokitoki restores the Time Nest to it's original state, Xeno Trunks and the others celebrate their victory.<br><br><h4>Universe Creation Saga</h4>
At the Time Nest, Chronoa tells Xeno Trunks and Xeno Pan that Tokitoki has gone missing, fearing that something bad could have happened, the two head off immediately in search of him using a device on Xeno Pan's wrist to travel to different eras. They travel back to Capsule Corporation in Age 780 where they find Tokitoki along with their current timeline family and friends and Vegeta explains to Goku that he is a version of Trunks from another dimension.<br><br>Shortly after all twelve Gods of Destruction appear in search of Tokitoki due to a prediction which resulted in a strange bird being responsible for destroying all universes. Xeno Trunks however, doesn't believe such a thing, telling Beerus that Tokitoki had previously saved all dimensions. When Beerus refuses to back down, Xeno Trunks joins the others in an attempt to take him on.<br><br>He strikes with his sword but Beerus stops it with his fingers before kicking him away. The fight is put to a halt with the arrival of Xeno Goku and Xeno Vegeta who point out the roots belonging to the Universe Tree. Fu shows up shortly afterwards and explains his plans to create a new universe using the tree. While Beerus does his best to halt the tree's energy absorption, he orders the others to do something about Fu and the tree at which point Xeno Trunks teams up with Goku and Vegeta and head off to search.<br><br>With assistance from Tokitoki, they head to an area where they soon sense two incoming enemies. Vegeta explains to Xeno Trunks that they are Bojack and Turles who attacked the Earth years ago. Xeno Trunks protects Xeno Pan while Goku and Vegeta confront them. Shortly afterwards, Fu appears along with Dogidogi and has the bird freeze everyone in place, allowing Fu to take the opportunity to capture Tokitoki and escape.<br><br>Some time later, Xeno Trunks and the rest of their group unexpectedly fall into Hell through a time distortion. There they meet up once again with Xeno Goku and Xeno Vegeta as well as the hostile Janemba. Xeno Trunks, having transformed into Super Saiyan 3, joins the other Saiyans in attacking Janemba with a unison energy blast though Janemba withstands it unscathed. Xeno Trunks then recognizes Putine and Salsa when they arrive and confront Janemba. Xeno Trunks explains to Goku that the two are beings from the demon realm who they defeated once before. When Janemba returns to the battlefield Xeno Trunks proceeds to transform into Super Saiyan God which shocks both Goku and Vegeta. However even with this increase in power, Janemba proves to be too powerful. With little other choice, Xeno Trunks, Xeno Pan, Goku and Vegeta pool their Saiyan Power into Xeno Goku and Xeno Vegeta allowing them to enter into the Super Full Power Saiyan 4 Limit Breaker state where they go on to finish off Janemba. Then he and the others are teleported to the location of the Universe Tree thanks to Putines magic. </div>

<p>
The Superhero Database Classification number, or SHDB Class, is a number that represents the overall 'power' of a character. All traits of a character are used for calculating the Classification.
</p>
<h5>What it DOESN'T mean</h5>
<p>
This doesn't mean that a higher class would always beat a lower class character. But the bigger the difference in Class is, the more obvious it is who'll win in a fight.
</p>
<h5>How is this calculated</h5>
<pre class="footnote">( INT^1.3 + (STR*0.5 )^2 + (SPE*0.5)^2 + DUR^1.6 + (POW + (SPS*SPL))^2 + COM^1.8 ) ^ TIER</pre>
<h6>Super Power Score and Level</h6>
<p>Every Super Power has a score (SPS) that is used to calculate the Class. Each Super Power also has 3 levels (SPL). The level is set when connecting that Super Power to a character. The level determines the final score, of the Super Power, being used in the calculation.
