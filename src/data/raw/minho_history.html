<h3>Minho's History</h3>
<h4>The Maze Runner</h4>
In the Maze Runner film, Minho is first introduced when he and Ben return from the Maze, running past Thomas and Chuck. He observes Thomas wrestling with Gally at the bonfire before the latter sends Thomas to the ground causing him to remember his name.<br><br>When Ben is banished, Minho leads him out from the Pit, cuts his bonds, and throws a pack with supplies into the Maze. He refuses to make eye contact with the former Runner as the other Keepers push Ben into the Maze.<br><br>Minho and Alby make a trip into the Maze the next morning with the hope to retrace Ben's steps. Later, Minho returns with an unconscious Alby, struggling to make it through the doors. Despite the other Gladers yelling at him to leave Alby behind, he continues to drag the older boy with him as the doors start to close. Before they close shut, Thomas slips through them in an attempt to help. Frustrated, Minho yells at Thomas for being stupid before starting to panic about the Grievers. Thomas points out that they need to help Alby in some way, before eyeing the walls of vines. Both start to pull Alby up one of the walls until Minho hears a Griever approaching. In a panic, he apologizes to Thomas before running in the opposite direction as the Griever enters their portion of the Maze.<br><br>After evading one Griever intent on following him, Thomas catches up with Minho who starts to lead him down a section of the Maze that is starting to change. He yells at Thomas to run while the latter taunts the Griever to come after him as the wall starts to close, crushing the Griever's body in between. The pair make it back to the Glade shortly after the doors open with Alby in tow. Chuck asks if they saw a Griever and Minho replies that Thomas didn't just see one, but killed it.<br><br>The Gladers hold a council over Thomas' act of running into the Maze despite their rules. Gally insists he needs to be punished while Newt addresses Minho, asking for his thoughts. Minho admits that no one's ever seen a Griever and lived to tell about it. He concludes that while he doesn't know whether Thomas acted bravely or stupidly for what he did, he says that they need more of it and suggests that Thomas become a Runner to the shock of the Keepers and Gladers alike. Before a decision can be made, The Box alarm sounds and Minho watches as Newt announces that the new arrival is a girl.<br><br>Minho accompanies Thomas, Newt, and the Med-jacks to the medical hut as they put an unconscious Teresa on a bunk next to Alby. Minho runs after Thomas, who is determined to go back into the Maze to examine the Griever corpse. Minho hesitates at the prospect of returning, especially since the other Runners quit on him earlier that morning. Eventually, he gathers up Frypan, Winston, and Zart to accompany him and Thomas into the Maze.<br><br>Once the group locates the corpse, Thomas points out that he sees something, prompting the group to tug on a leg to break it from the body. Minho pulls out something with a blinking light and notes that it has a digital number in the window, along with a WCKD nameplate on the side. The group returns with their findings to the council hall and share the information with Newt and Gally. Newt concludes that Thomas will be sent to the Pit without food for a night and decides to make Thomas a Runner, despite Gally's protests.<br><br>Minho takes Thomas to the Map Room to show him the model of the Maze he and the other Runners built over 3 years. He admits that he's run every part of the Maze but they've been unsuccessful in finding a pattern. He notes that Section 7 was open last night, which is unusual, as it is not supposed to be open for another week. He and Thomas plan to go out and check out the Section the next morning, before Jeff and Clint run into the Map Room, saying that Teresa is awake.<br><br>The next morning, Minho frees Thomas from the Pit, asking if the latter is having second thoughts. Thomas confirms that he's ready to go and Minho leads them to Section 7, which happens to be open. He spots a stained tank on the ground and concludes it was Ben's, meaning the former Runner had been here at one point. Thomas picks up on a beeping sound coming from the metal cylinder they ripped from the Griever's body and uses it to follow where the signal is strong. Eventually, they are led to the back of Section 7 and the cylinder unlocks a hidden door. The boys enter and find another area, which they conclude is the Griever's entrance. Something scans them and walls start to close, prompting both boys to return to the Glade. They share their information with the Gladers before Teresa tells them that Alby is awake.<br><br>Minho watches as Thomas and Newt address Alby, the latter who remembers his life before the Maze and that Thomas helped to put him in there. He breaks down and cries before a Glader tells the group that the doors aren't closing. Grievers charge through the open doors and Minho joins the others as they hide in the council hall. He is forced to witness Alby being taken by the Grievers after the leader protected Chuck from being stung.<br><br>Once the Grievers leave, Gally emerges from his hiding place and punches Thomas in the face. Minho and the remaining Keepers restrain Gally, telling him it isn't Thomas' fault. He rushes to Thomas' side as the other boy injects himself with the Griever's stinger to trigger his memories back. A few days later, Thomas wakes up in the Pit, and Newt reveals that Gally has taken command. Newt tells Thomas that he was onto something and that he needs to finish what he started.<br><br>Gally leads Teresa and Thomas out to the edge of the Glade near the doors, intending to use them as sacrifices to the Grievers. Minho and Newt stand off to the side, watching as Gally's friends try to tie up Thomas, who fights back and knocks them unconscious. Both join Thomas and Teresa, who plan to leave the Maze to see if they can find a new life outside.<br><br>Minho fights alongside the small group of Gladers who accompany them and is almost killed by Griever until Jeff intervenes. Teresa punches in the Section numbers based on the patterns Minho discovered, which opens a door into a hallway. After locating the exit, they observe the fallen soldiers and mess left in the control room. Thomas pulls up a message left by Ava Paige and the group watches as she tries to explain why they conducted the Maze Trials in the first place.<br><br>Once the message ends, the group begins to head out until Gally, who has been stung by a Griever, calls out to them, telling them that they can't leave. Gally aims a gun at Thomas, but Minho throws a spear into Gally's chest just as Gally shoots a bullet into Chuck's chest, killing him. Gally also dies while the group mourns Chuck before a group of soldiers enter the control room and lead them to a helicopter outside, claiming that they are safe.<br><br><h4>The Scorch Trials</h4>
In the Scorch Trials film, Minho yells Thomas' name, telling him to wake up as they have to exit the berg. He and the other surviving Gladers are ushered inside a large warehouse-like building before being taken to a room with a table of food laid out for them.<br><br>Later, Janson visits the group after they have devoured the feast and shows them around the warehouse, claiming it is a Safe Haven from WCKD and the elements. Minho questions him about why they were saved and helped, to which Janson replies that the world is falling apart and that the Gladers are valuable after escaping. He directs the Gladers to the shower room before they're given physicals and tests are run on them. Minho is jogging on a treadmill when Thomas is pulled aside for questioning by Janson.<br><br>After the meeting, Thomas meets up with Minho and the other male Gladers in the dining room. Minho reveals that they weren't the only Maze experiment, leading him to a table where two boys from another Maze strike up a conversation with them. The other two boys note that they just arrived, versus Aris, who arrived a week ago. When Janson begins reading off the names of various individuals, the group questions what just happened. They are told that these lucky few who were called are being taken to a Safe Haven, supposedly some kind of farm, but only a small number can be transported out at a time.<br><br>When shown to their room, Minho claims a top bunk and falls asleep, while Thomas is woken by Aris, who shows him a mysterious room where gurneys are wheeled in every night. Thomas expresses concerns about their location, while the others think he's being paranoid. Choosing to ignore Newt's advice, Thomas gets into a shoving match with one of the guards in an attempt to swipe his ID card. As punishment, the Group A boys are sent back to their dorm. Minho and the others express frustration over Thomas' reckless behaviour until the latter reveals he had swiped the ID card to access the mysterious room with Aris.<br><br>Moments later, Thomas and Aris return, warning the Group A guys that they need to get out of the base. Thomas reveals that WCKD rescued them and that they aren't safe. The group gathers their possessions and crawls out through the air vents. Aris and Winston split up to handle something and Minho, Thomas, Newt, and Frypan attempt to search for Teresa. They run into the female doctor tending to Teresa and hold her hostage as they search for her room. Eventually, guards find them thanks to the alarm that has sounded, and Minho, in anger and frustration, jumps and knocks out a guard, stealing his gun for protection.<br><br>The doctor takes them to the room where Teresa is being tested and Minho holds the gun while Newt ties up the other medical personnel. As guards struggle to get into Teresa's room, Minho fires at them while Newt and Thomas break the glass on the window to get out. Minho tosses over the gun to Thomas as he climbs out of the room and the group begins heading for the exit.<br><br>Thomas assumes possession of the gun as Minho and Newt struggle with scanning the ID card. Once they get the door open, they cross to the other side before Janson orders security to close the door. Thomas is forced to abandon the gun and run, barely making it before the door closes. Aris breaks the keypad on their end to prevent anyone from letting Janson out.<br><br>The group manages to unlock the large lock on the door and make their way into the Scorch. They seek refuge in an abandoned mall/warehouse and start gathering supplies for their journey into the mountains. Minho and Thomas check for a light source and stumble across a generator, that brings the power on for the majority of the warehouse. Minho yells at Thomas to look out like a deranged woman missing her eyes comes charging at him through a gate. Her cries alert more like her and the guys are forced to run, yelling at the others to run.<br><br>The group defends themselves as best as they can against their attackers, finding a door that leads out. Winston reveals a gun he grabbed from WCKD and tries to ward off the Cranks with bullets. The group gets the door open, only to have Cranks grab and scratch at Winston's stomach before he's pulled to safety. The Gladers hide in a basement level crawlspace from the Cranks, waiting for them to disappear.<br><br>The next morning, the group discovers they are alone and start heading into the ruins of the city. Thomas hears Bergs flying overhead and yells at the group to hide as they pass. They decide to head for the mountains to find the Right Arm, a resistance group that has been reportedly raiding WCKD bases and labs in search of Immunes to rescue.<br><br>As they travel on, Winston worsens and the guys take turns carrying him. While resting, Winston gets ahold of the gun and the others struggle, trying to get it away from him. The former reveals his injuries are getting worse and he doesn't want to become one of them. He begs the group to leave him so he can end his life.<br><br>Minho expresses sadness over losing Winston later that night. The others admit that they thought they were supposed to be Immune, while Teresa reveals that not all of them are. Newt says that they need to assume that they could also not be Immune as well.<br><br>The group begins to run out of supplies and continues to struggle against the harsh conditions in the Scorch. Thomas notices a building in the distance and encourages the group to run to it as a thunderstorm rages. Minho is hit by lightning, lying unconscious on the ground. Thomas and the others help Minho get into the building and manage to revive him. They discover they're surrounded by chained up Cranks and huddle close until a young woman addresses their presence. She leads them to Jorge, who asks them three questions. Minho challenges the question about where they came from, stating that its their business. This prompts Jorge's men to hold down the Gladers while the young woman, named Brenda, scans Thomas's neck. She shows the result to Jorge, who notes that they came from WCKD, which makes them valuable.<br><br>The Gladers are strung upside over an open hole in the warehouse. Minho complains about Thomas agreeing to talk/listen to Jorge and the group notices that the lever to lower them is close to Teresa. Before they can initiate their plan, Jorge visits them and asks them what they know about the Right Arm. When Jorge is unconvinced by the small amount of information given, he drops the Gladers a short distance before Thomas reveals he only knows that they are supposedly in the mountains. This prompts Jorge to leave them hanging while he packs up his possessions, planning to take the Gladers and Brenda to the Right Arm with the hope that they'll be granted access to the Safe Haven too.<br><br>Once Teresa reaches the lever, she gets herself free and helps the rest of the group get loose. Before they can escape, a henchman of Jorge's returns, planning to sell them out to WCKD. Thomas tries to fight him, only to have the henchman point a gun at them. Brenda kills the henchman and leads the group to the zipline to escape. Minho slides after Jorge and escapes the warehouse before its blown up.<br><br>Minho, Newt, Frypan, Aris, Teresa, and Jorge travel to the city to find Marcus, a man who has worked with the Right Arm to smuggle Immune kids to a Safe Haven. They find Marcus had lured and drugged Brenda and Thomas, planning to offer them with other drugged Immunes to WCKD. Jorge tortures Marcus for information while the group looks on. Eventually, Marcus reveals that they are in the mountains but it will take a week to get there. Jorge then reveals that he will be "borrowing" Bertha, Marcus's car.<br><br>The Gladers and Jorge journey to the base of the mountains where the road is blocked by abandoned cars, forcing the group to travel on foot. Before they walk any further, they are ambushed by bullets shot from above. Two girls confront Jorge and Thomas, ordering them to drop the grenade Jorge has in his hand. The Gladers are rounded up and ordered on their feet by the girls, who turn out to be Sonya and Harriet from Aris' Maze. The trio reunite and the girls reveal that they are working with the Right Arm.<br><br>They take the Gladers to their camp and reveal that they are planning to head to the Safe Haven tomorrow morning. The leader Vince wants to check all of the newcomers to see if they are Immune, which is interrupted by Brenda succumbing to her injuries from a Crank. Vince plans to shoot Brenda until Mary Cooper steps in, offering to help Brenda when she realizes that Thomas is with them.<br><br>The Gladers are given food and warm clothing for the night. They are relieved to be free from WCKD but Minho expresses his doubts about Aris, saying that he doesn't trust him. Thomas breaks away from the group to find Teresa, who reluctantly reveals that she called WCKD, saying that the group needs to help them find a cure. Minho tries to help Vince fight WCKD soldiers as the base is ambushed but is hit and is knocked to the ground.<br><br>WCKD soldiers arrange all of the Right Arm volunteers and Immunes into lines, scanning the tattoos at the back of their necks to check them in. WCKD reads off Minho as A4 before moving onto the next person. Thomas gives himself up, being forced into line beside Minho. Minho tells him he should have run but Thomas mutters he's done running.<br><br>When Teresa reveals to the group and the Right Arm that she shared their location, the Gladers express disbelief and are upset at her betrayal. She insists that they won't be harmed but they need to help WCKD find a cure for the world. Mary Cooper steps forward and announces to Ava Paige that at least she'll die with a conscience. Janson shoots her and Thomas pulls out the grenade from Jorge's bag, yelling that he would rather die than go with WCKD. Minho, Newt, and Frypan vote to die with him, despite Ava and Teresa's pleas. Before Thomas can detonate the grenade, Jorge charges at WCKD soldiers in a borrowed car. The Right Arm starts fighting back while some of the Immunes are loaded into the berg.<br><br>Minho shoots at the soldiers while Vince fires his machine gun at the soldiers. He runs out of ammo and is hit by a stun gun. WCKD soldiers take him to the berg as Thomas yells his name.<br><br><h4>The Death Cure</h4>
In the Death Cure film, Minho wakes up in a field, which to his horror turns out to be the Glade. The Glade seems empty and overgrown. Minho sees three figures standing by the entrance of one of the doors. He also sees a boy run into a hut. Minho follows the boy, but he suddenly finds himself in a labyrinth being pursued by a Griever. Minho runs through the twisting maze-like building, but is stopped by a mysterious force that forces him to the ceiling as the Griever attacks him. It is revealed that Minho is really in a lab being tested on. WCKD is making him dream of the situations to get his blood. Teresa, now in full scientist gear, is seen observing him.<br><br>A couple of days later, Minho is again in the medical lab. The doctors decide to raise his doses, even though they risk his life by doing this. Minho manages to knock them out and flee. In the corridors, he meets Thomas and Newt, who have come to rescue him.<br><br>Together, they fight off Janson and several guards, finally locking themselves in a room. Their persecutors are on their heels and there is no way out. The three former Gladers barricade the door and smash the windows. When Janson and his men finally open the door, the three teenagers have but one chance to jump out of the window, several hundred feet down into a pool.<br><br>When they get out of the pool, four masked soldiers approach them. They know they have no chance left and are ready to finally give up, when one of the soldiers shoots the other three, takes his helmet off, and reveals himself to be Gally. Minho is shocked to see that he is alive, and Gally tells him, Thomas, and Newt that they are nuts.<br><br>While hiding from the WCKD soldiers with Thomas and Newt, Minho asks Gally why he is helping them, as he put a spear through his chest. Gally tells Minho that nobody is perfect.<br><br>Newt is getting worse every minute and is not even able to walk alone. So Minho and Gally run to find Brenda with the serum and bring her to Newt. Minho and Gally hear Teresa's voice broadcasted throughout the city, calling Thomas back to WCKD, telling him that his blood is the cure and he can save Newt like he did Brenda. But when they and Frypan arrive with Brenda, Thomas has killed Newt. Thomas then walks off back to WCKD, leaving Minho, Gally, Frypan, and Brenda to gather around Newt.<br><br>Minho, Gally, Frypan, and Brenda return to the berg where Jorge flies them, Vince, and the Immune children to the top of the WCKD building where Thomas and Teresa are. Thomas is too wounded and weak to get on the berg due to being shot in the stomach by Janson, but with Teresa's help, they and Vince manage to haul him on board. Teresa falls to her death when the WCKD building collapses.<br><br>Minho, Thomas, Gally, Frypan, Brenda, Jorge, Vince, and the Immune kids fly to the Safe Haven to live in peace.<br><br>It is revealed in a deleted scene that when Newt attempted suicide in the Maze by jumping off a Maze wall, Minho was the one who brought him back to the Glade right before the doors closed. (Newt gives this as a reason to rescue Minho when he is held hostage by WCKD and being run tests on.) </div>

<p>
The Superhero Database Classification number, or SHDB Class, is a number that represents the overall 'power' of a character. All traits of a character are used for calculating the Classification.
</p>
<h5>What it DOESN'T mean</h5>
<p>
This doesn't mean that a higher class would always beat a lower class character. But the bigger the difference in Class is, the more obvious it is who'll win in a fight.
</p>
<h5>How is this calculated</h5>
<pre class="footnote">( INT^1.3 + (STR*0.5 )^2 + (SPE*0.5)^2 + DUR^1.6 + (POW + (SPS*SPL))^2 + COM^1.8 ) ^ TIER</pre>
<h6>Super Power Score and Level</h6>
<p>Every Super Power has a score (SPS) that is used to calculate the Class. Each Super Power also has 3 levels (SPL). The level is set when connecting that Super Power to a character. The level determines the final score, of the Super Power, being used in the calculation.
