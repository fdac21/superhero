<h3>Gohan's History</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
Gohan was born in May 18 of Age 757, about a year after Goku and Chi-Chi married following the conclusion of the 23rd World Martial Arts Tournament. As a newborn, he went on for a time without a name until Goku's grandfather's name was mentioned, which Gohan liked, as opposed to the name his mother chose (Einstein). His early childhood was a pampered one, unlike his father's. His life was relatively well-balanced with a loving family and a nice home. Gohan was well-adjusted and intelligent, but unlike his father as a child, he lacked any affection for fighting and was easily scared at a level that most normal children would be. Goku gave Gohan the four star Dragon Ball and put it into a hat for him to honor his grandpa. Once, Goku and Chi-Chi were walking through a meadow with Gohan on a stroller, but the stroller was accidentally released, causing them to chase after it. Gohan was then sent flying out of the stroller, but his latent powers' brief awakening not only allowed him to survive crashing into a tree, but also plowing a hole through the trunk, amazing Goku at the hidden power of Gohan.<br><br><h4>Saiyan Saga</h4>
Despite Goku's protests, Chi-Chi home-schools Gohan to be a scholar until he is four, before Goku takes him to Kame House to introduce him to Master Roshi, Bulma and Krillin. At this time, he is shown as a shy, but very smart boy who also has a tail like Goku once had before it was removed. He is also very sensitive and appears cowardly at some times. While Goku reunites and talks with his old friends, Gohan rides on Turtle's back, and plays Rock-Paper-Scissors with a crab, enjoying himself. After Goku's brother, Raditz, explains his Saiyan origins and attacks Goku with ease, he kidnaps Gohan while the latter rushed to his father's aid, putting Goku at a stalemate, that if he does not kill 100 humans by the next day, Raditz will eliminate his nephew.<br><br>Gohan soon gets locked up in Raditz's space pod, because Raditz cannot stand his constant crying. It is during this time that Raditz discovers that Gohan is potentially far stronger than Goku himself. During the battle between Goku, Raditz, and Piccolo, Gohan becomes angry and breaks free of the space pod he is being held captive in when he spots Raditz torturing Goku by repeatedly kicking one of Goku's broken ribs. He delivers a devastating blow to his uncle, giving Goku and Piccolo time to kill the evil Saiyan, though Goku dies in the process as well.<br><br>After the battle with Raditz, Piccolo, having seen Gohan's power first hand, decides to take Gohan out training in the wilderness. He leaves Gohan alone to survive against dinosaurs and other dangers for six months, though during this time he watches Gohan carefully. During the first six nights, while complaining about the sour flavor of the apples Piccolo has given him, Gohan accidentally looks at a full moon and transforms into a Great Ape. Piccolo (seemingly) destroys the moon, causing Gohan to revert into his normal form before Gohan destroys too much of the land. Piccolo yanks his tail off, then reconstitutes his clothing, giving him a uniform similar to Goku's. The difference: it bears the Demon symbol, to symbolize him being Piccolo's student. For the rest of the year, Piccolo shows no mercy as he teaches Gohan how to fight. Soon, Gohan's bright and cheerful nature makes Piccolo protective over the young boy. As the boy grows on Piccolo, the two of them have a few conversations about Piccolo's past and why he did the things he did and Gohan tells Piccolo he thinks he is not as bad as everyone has told him.<br><br>Eventually, the time comes for the Z Fighters to take on the remaining two Saiyans, Vegeta and Nappa. Piccolo senses the Saiyans making their approach and tells Gohan to be ready, when he suddenly senses a third ki from another direction. They think it is another Saiyan but soon find out that it is Krillin who joins them to fight the Saiyans. The Saiyans find them and before the fight starts, they decide to test their Saibamen against the Z Fighters. Soon Yamcha, Tien Shinhan, and Chiaotzu join them in the fight. While Yamcha and one Saibaman fight, Gohan cannot keep up with their speed through his eyes alone, so Piccolo orders Gohan to concentrate and find them using Ki Sense, which Gohan is eventually able to master quickly. When Nappa begins to fight after Yamcha is killed and the six Saibamen are destroyed, Gohan is able to sometimes control his fear but becomes frightened and hides behind rocks because at times his age catches up with him. This prevents him from being very effective in the battle, except for short intervals, such as a point when he single-handedly kicks Nappa through a boulder. During one part of the battle, Piccolo hatches a plan for Gohan to blast Nappa after Piccolo has kicked him towards Krillin, and Krillin then will kick Nappa towards Gohan for the attack. The first two thirds of the plan work accordingly, but when it is Gohan's turn, Gohan cowers behind more boulders, botching the plan, resulting in Piccolo calling him a worthless coward. When Vegeta gives the group three hours for Goku to arrive, Piccolo loses all hope in Gohan, and after some bickering, he orders Gohan to go home. However, Gohan refuses and even realizes Nappa would not let him go away.<br><br>When the fight continues after Goku fails to arrive on time, Gohan regains his confidence and does his best to amend for his previous cowardice. Piccolo hatches another plan for Gohan to attack Nappa after Krillin distracts him and Piccolo grabs his tail. Though Gohan quickly goes on the assault, the plan fails when Nappa is shown to have overcome his tail's weakness. Eventually, when Nappa fires a lethal energy blast at Gohan, Piccolo throws himself in front of Gohan and takes the impact. Gohan watches his mentor slowly die, and while Piccolo confesses his true bond with Gohan, Gohan's emotions once again take over, starting to cry in extreme anger. Once Piccolo slowly passes on, Gohan in turn fires a powerful Masenko at Nappa, which does only minimal damage to his arm. With that last Masenko consuming all the energy he had left, Gohan decides to give up and meet his fate, despite Krillin's protests for him to run. He is almost squashed by Nappa, but is saved by the Flying Nimbus when the resurrected Goku finally arrives to the battle. After eating a Senzu Bean with Krillin, he watches Goku overpower Nappa. When Vegeta kills Nappa, Goku tells Gohan to let him battle Vegeta alone, not wanting Gohan to get hurt again.<br><br>Later on, after Vegeta turns into a Great Ape using a Power Ball and injures Goku, Gohan returns to the battle. After Yajirobe chops off Vegeta's tail, making him transform back, Gohan was stunned by the true powers of Saiyans. He then fights Vegeta alone while Krillin and a broken Goku prepare to fire a Spirit Bomb, the last resort. Krillin fires the Spirit Bomb, but misses. Gohan bounces it back, hitting Vegeta, but not killing him. Gohan himself transforms into a Great Ape after looking at Vegeta's Power Ball. He defeats Vegeta by landing on him after Vegeta cuts his tail with a Destructo Disc. Afterwards, Goku lets Vegeta go, hoping to one day face him again.<br><br><h4>Frieza Saga</h4>
After recovering from his injuries in West City hospital, Wukong Hospital, Gohan chose to go to the planet Namek with Krillin and Bulma to gather the Namekian Dragon Balls to bring back his friends back to life, because Piccolo's death caused Kami's death too, which caused the Earth's Dragon Balls to turn to stone. Gohan was on a personal mission to wish back Piccolo, and went so far as to wear a copy of Piccolo's dōgi to honor him.<br><br>After their long trip, with a few sidetracks, they finally make it to Namek, where they find out Vegeta has also come seeking the Dragon Balls, along with his former far more powerful boss, Frieza. While scouting the planet with Krillin, Gohan spots Frieza and his minions, Zarbon and Dodoria, tormenting Namekian villagers. When Gohan sees Dodoria, one of Frieza's top henchmen, attack a little Namekian child named Dende, he goes out and attacks him. Afterwards, Dodoria chases Gohan, Krillin and Dende, but they eventually lose him and Vegeta kills Dodoria.<br><br>Gohan and Krillin bring the young Namekian Dende to their hiding spot. Bulma awaits them in a Capsule House and is surprised to see Dende. After a meal, Dende explains to them that there is a Dragon Ball kept safe with Grand Elder Guru, the ruler of the Namekians. After Dende takes Krillin to see Guru, Bulma notices that the Dragon Radar is picking up a solitary Dragon Ball in an isolated place (where Vegeta hid it earlier underwater), and has Gohan go retrieve it. Gohan steals a Dragon Ball that Vegeta has hid in a lake for himself, and even tricks Vegeta who runs into him on his way back from retrieving the ball. After Gohan returns to the hideout he meets up again with Krillin who takes him to see Guru where he unlocks his hidden potential. Vegeta eventually figures out that Gohan stole his Dragon Ball and becomes enraged, but the arrival of the Ginyu Force makes Vegeta have to form an alliance with Gohan and Krillin in order to get all the Dragon Balls and put up a fight against Frieza's feared Special Forces. Unfortunately, when they gather all of the Dragon Balls, they are ambushed by the Ginyu Force. The weakest of them, Guldo, is to take on Krillin and Gohan, but fails as Vegeta steps in and decapitates him with his hand.<br><br>Then, when Vegeta is fighting a losing battle against Recoome, Krillin and Gohan step in and fight, but it is still not enough. Gohan is on the brink of death until Goku shows up with Senzu Beans. Goku takes on the rest of them, but has his body switched by Captain Ginyu. With Goku completely weak in Captain Ginyu's body, Gohan has to try to fight Captain Ginyu in his father's body (although he is initially reluctant to do so, despite knowing it is not his dad, as he still feels he is injuring his dad by doing so). Captain Ginyu is unable to fully figure out Goku's powers and after a short fight with Gohan, Krillin, and Goku in Ginyu's body, Vegeta kills Jeice and ultimately defeats Ginyu. After Captain Ginyu ends up in a frog's body, Gohan and the others gather the Namekian Dragon Balls and wish for Piccolo to be brought back to life on Namek.<br><br>Shortly after, Frieza ambushes them, making them stall for Piccolo to come. In the Z Fighters' battle against Frieza's second form, Krillin is injured by the tyrant and is sent into the depths of the water below. Gohan rushes to save his friend from drowning, but Frieza stops him. Getting angry, Gohan attacks Frieza with a barrage of punches and kicks followed by the Gekiretsu Madan (a massive wave of energy blasts), following up with a Masendan to finish the job, that would bring the tyrant to his knees. When Piccolo (now greatly powered up after fusing with the Namekian hero Nail) arrives on the battle field, he fights an even battle against Frieza while Gohan and the others watch in amazement.<br><br>However, Frieza transforms into his third transformation and gains the upper hand against Piccolo. Seeing this, Gohan becomes enraged and attacks Frieza with the Full Power Masenko, hindering Frieza for a few minutes. Eventually, Frieza manages to deflect the attack back at Gohan, who is saved by Piccolo when he destroys the attack with a Ki Blast. Frieza then transforms into his final form, and as his first act, kills Dende, who had been healing the Z Fighters. Frieza then tries to kill Gohan with a Death Beam, but Vegeta saves the young Saiyan by kicking him out of the way of the blast. Gohan, Krillin, and Piccolo watch in horror as Vegeta gets brutally beaten by Frieza until Goku arrives. In the end, Vegeta meets his end at the hands of Frieza, who kills him with a Death Beam.<br><br>Gohan and the others are left on the sidelines while Goku fights an even battle against Frieza. However, things turn bad when Frieza powers up to 50% of his power and gains the upper hand against Goku, who desperately attempts to use the Spirit Bomb. In order to buy Goku some time, Gohan and Krillin lend their energy to Piccolo so he can stall Frieza enough for Goku to complete his Large Spirit Bomb. When Frieza prepares to kill Piccolo, Gohan and Krillin summon up the last of their energy and distract the tyrant with a surprise attack, saving the Namekian's life. Goku then fires his completed Spirit Bomb. It proves successful and Frieza is plummeted into the depths of the Spirit Bomb, heavily injuring him.<br><br>Believing the tyrant to be dead, the heroes relax and prepare to go back home to Earth, until Frieza appears on top of a boulder and reveals to be alive. Frieza mortally wounds Piccolo (in the anime, Frieza attempted to fire a Death Beam at Goku, but Piccolo pushed him out of the way and got hit by the laser instead, whereas in manga, Frieza intended to fire the attack at Piccolo), overwhelming Gohan with horror and grief at the presumed death of his mentor and friend. Next, Frieza kills Krillin, by telekinetically blowing him up into pieces, which enrages Goku and allows him to transform into a Super Saiyan. He assertively orders Gohan to take Piccolo and retrieve Bulma and take them to the ship that he traveled in and use it to head back to Earth. Reluctantly obeying his father's wishes, Gohan leaves the battle field with the unconscious Piccolo and manages to retrieve Bulma.<br><br>Later, when he senses that his father is supposedly dead, Gohan returns to the fight to stall Frieza before Namek explodes. However, despite his best efforts, he is unable to stall Frieza as the tyrant taunts him and he is not fighting, in addition to Frieza deducing the real reason Gohan is attempting to fight him. However, Gohan then senses that his father is still alive and powers up. Next, Gohan attacks Frieza with a barrage of punches and kicks, while expressing anger that Frieza harmed Goku, knocking him to the ground and finally blasting him with a Super Masenko. Unfortunately, Frieza appears unaffected by the attack and powers up to full power again, saying that Gohan is a true Saiyan and that is why Frieza must kill him. However, before Frieza can kill Gohan, Goku rises up from the ocean below and tells Gohan to get off Namek. Gohan flies away from the fight and encourages his father to win. As Gohan is flying back to the spaceship, he and the others are later transported to Earth by Porunga while Goku is left finishing the battle with Frieza on the dying planet Namek.<br><br>After Goku wins the battle, but is caught in planet Namek's explosion, Gohan and the others mourn the Saiyan warrior's apparent death. Months later, they are allowed to use the Namekian Dragon Balls to wish Goku back to life. However, they are shocked after the Eternal Dragon Porunga refuses the wish that Goku be brought back to life, but everyone rejoices once the Dragon explains that Goku did not die from Namek's explosion. During this time of peace, everyone awaits the arrival of Goku, and Gohan goes back to his studies while Piccolo watches over him and his mother.<br><br><h4>Frieza-Androids Interlude</h4>
A year after (two years later in Funimation dub) Goku defeated Frieza on Namek, Gohan and Chi-Chi still wait for Goku's safe return to Earth. However, things turn bad when the Z Fighters sense Frieza heading towards Earth, along with another powerful being: his father, King Cold. Gohan and the Z Fighters regroup where Frieza and King Cold's spaceship is landing, at Northern Wastelands, but without Goku's help, the Earth appears to be doomed. However, when Frieza and King Cold land on Earth, they are confronted by a mysterious youth, who transforms into a Super Saiyan and easily destroys Frieza and King Cold along with their henchmen.<br><br>After the fight, he tells the others to follow him to when and where Goku will be arriving. After waiting two hours (three in the manga), Goku arrives on Earth and he and the youth have a private talk. With the conversation over, the youth departs to his future, but promises to meet them again when the Androids arrive. During the next three years, Gohan trains hard with Goku and Piccolo to prepare for the Android threat.<br><br><h4>Androids Saga</h4>
Three years later, the Z Fighters locate the Androids on an island nine miles southwest of South City. However, not wanting to fight in the city in fear of causing more damage after Gero had already destroyed half of the city, they fly to a wasteland so they can fight. Goku transforms into his Super Saiyan form and dominates Android 19, until the Saiyan contracts the heart virus Future Trunks warned him about three years prior, allowing Android 19 to gain the upper hand and steals some of Goku's energy. Goku, however, is saved by the arrival of Vegeta, who transforms into a Super Saiyan himself and easily destroys Android 19 while the Z Fighters watch in amazement.<br><br>With Android 19 destroyed, Android 20 becomes scared and retreats, with the Z Fighters in pursuit. During the search, Piccolo is suddenly ambushed by Android 20, who attempts to steal the Namekian's energy and use it against Vegeta. Luckily, Piccolo telepathically contacts Gohan and tells him to come help him. Gohan soon arrives and knocks Dr. Gero down to the ground, saving Piccolo's life as the Z Fighters gather around. Piccolo then fights Android 20 alone and dominates the android with the strength he achieved from the last three years of intense training, cutting off one of Gero's hands. Future Trunks then comes back from the future and arrives on the battle field with the Z Fighters, only to discover that these Androids are not the ones in his future timeline. However, Android 20 manages to escape and the Z Fighters search for him while Gohan flies Bulma, Trunks, and Yajirobe back home to Capsule Corporation. Dr. Gero makes it back to his lab and activates two of his more powerful creations, Android 17 and Android 18. However, the Androids rebel and kill Dr. Gero and proceeded to activate another android, Android 16, whose sole purpose is to kill Goku. The Z Fighters battle the new Androids, only to be badly beaten as the Androids fly away to find and kill Goku.<br><br><h4>Cell Saga</h4>
When the Z Fighters are in an airplane with a weakened Goku, flying away from the Androids, Gohan and Future Trunks leave and meet with Bulma to investigate an old time machine that was used to travel to the past. The time machine is covered in moss and has a large hole at the top. In there, they find a large egg shell split in half, but can not get any conclusions from it. Then, Gohan finds some thing unusual in the distance: the skin of a huge bug (later known as the android, Cell). Bulma takes the shell with her to do some more investigating.<br><br>After Goku is cured from the heart virus, he takes Gohan, Future Trunks, and Vegeta up at The Lookout, where they are shown by Mr. Popo a special room up at Kami's Lookout, known as the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, in preparation for a new threat: Cell. In the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, Future Trunks and Vegeta both enter the room first for the whole day while Goku and Gohan wait and sense that Piccolo (now fused with Kami and returned to the original nameless Namekian) is fighting against the Androids. Gohan tries to go down to Earth and help Piccolo, but Goku does not let him go and explains he is not strong enough and will only get in Piccolo's way. Goku tells Gohan as soon as they get their training done, they will go down to Earth and help Piccolo.<br><br>Later, when Piccolo was nearly killed by a powered-up Cell, who arrived on the battle field between Piccolo and Android 17, Goku and Gohan sense Piccolo's energy disappear. Believing his mentor to be dead, an enraged Gohan tries to go down to Earth, but is held and calmed down by Goku. Still angered, Gohan flies up into the air and tries to escape from the Lookout, but is punched down to the ground by Goku. As Mr. Popo rushes to help him, he explains to Gohan that Goku is hurting inside too and is even more angry than Gohan about Piccolo's near death. Gohan and Goku apologize to each other for their actions, and Goku promises that he will not let Piccolo's sacrifice be in vain.<br><br>After Cell absorbs Android 17 and achieved his Semi-Perfect form, he is about to set his sights on Android 18 when Tien Shinhan arrives and attacks Cell with his Neo Tri-Beam, allowing Android 18 and Android 16 (who was injured by Semi-Perfect Cell) to escape. Goku and Gohan sense Tien's energy decreasing and he finally collapses from exhaustion. Just before Semi-Perfect Cell can kill Tien, Goku uses Instant Transmission to appear on the battle field. He grabs the barely alive Tien and Piccolo and teleports back to the Lookout, where they are fully healed with a Senzu Bean. Piccolo explains that despite their best efforts against Semi-Perfect Cell, they proved useless.<br><br>At that moment, Mr. Popo interrupts and brings the group to the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, where Future Trunks and Vegeta emerge stronger than ever. They are given new Saiyan armor by Bulma (who by this time already arrived) and fly down to the Earth to confront Semi-Perfect Cell. While Vegeta and Future Trunks fight Semi-Perfect Cell, Goku and Gohan enter and train in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber while wearing some new Saiyan armor made by Bulma. In the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, Gohan struggles to transform into a Super Saiyan. Goku informs him that to become a Super Saiyan, it must be triggered by anger and rage. Gohan realizes the only way to become a Super Saiyan is for his father to fight him at full power. Hesitantly, Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan and fires a powerful Kamehameha at Gohan. Gohan blocks the attack and thinks about all the other times he was not able to help his friends whenever they were in danger while his friends helped him out if he was in danger.<br><br>Thinking about this, Gohan becomes overwhelmed with rage, allowing him to transform into a Super Saiyan and fire the Kamehameha back at Goku, who dodges the attack and tells his son to focus his energy, making him return to his base form. Goku tells Gohan they can take a break and even gives his son a haircut. Later, Gohan again transforms into his Super Saiyan form and trains while Goku sits down and watches his son's training in his Super Saiyan form improve. Gohan gets tired and transforms back into his base form when Goku demonstrates the second and third grade forms (which are the forms that Vegeta and Future Trunks are using against Cell, who by this time had achieved his perfect form by absorbing Android 18).<br><br>Seeing this incredible strength and power, Gohan is sure Goku can beat Cell, but Goku says he can not. He explains that because his muscles are now bulky, they slow down his speed, which is obviously important in the fight with Cell. Goku tells Gohan that transforming into a Super Saiyan takes a great deal of energy, but they need all the Super Saiyan energy they can get. Goku comes up with a plan to transform into a Super Saiyan Full Power, so he tells Gohan to try and stay transformed as a Super Saiyan for the whole day when it starts to feel normal.<br><br>At some point during their training, Goku prepared to call it a day, but then Gohan then manages to surprise Goku by transforming into an unprecedented Super Saiyan form before collapsing from exhaustion. Although Gohan does not remember it due to the strain of this initial transformation, it ended up being the catalyst that caused Goku to realize that, should Cell achieve his perfect form, Gohan is the only one of the Z-Fighters, including Goku himself, who would stand any chance at defeating Cell in even that state.<br><br>With their training finally completed, Gohan and Goku emerge earlier than expected from the Hyperbolic Time Chamber as Super Saiyan Full Powers. As Goku and Gohan are eating food made by Mr. Popo (because they do not really know how to cook when they were in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber), Future Trunks, after being defeated by Perfect Cell along with his father Vegeta, tells them that Perfect Cell is hosting a tournament for the Earth's strongest warriors called the Cell Games, to which Goku thinks of it as an interesting challenge. While Goku wears his trademark orange and blue clothes for the tournament, Gohan asks Piccolo for a copy of his uniform, since he was his first mentor. Piccolo conjures up a uniform similar to his for Gohan, who happily appreciates the new outfit.<br><br>Goku pays Perfect Cell a visit using Instant Transmission, and after returning, he claims he is no match for the android. Piccolo suggests they can still go in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber for extra training. However, Goku declines and says that he and Gohan can train outside the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, greatly surprising everyone. Goku and Gohan leave the Lookout, (after Goku and Gohan show Korin and Yajirobe their new power) and arrive at the Kame House to pick up Chi-Chi so they can go home. Gohan asks his father if they have a chance of beating Cell if they spend the next nine days resting and training outside. Goku laughs and says they do not have to worry about it now, since they have nine days to relax. Gohan and Goku go inside and meet everyone else (at one point, Oolong and Puar even say that Gohan has, "buffed up"). However, when Chi-Chi sees Goku and Gohan, she freaks out and exclaims that Gohan has become a hair-dyeing punk.<br><br>In a filler episode, Gohan flies to a village called Chazke Village to run a shopping errand for his mother. He meets Lime and Mr. Lao there, and later encounters one of his father's deadliest enemies in his childhood: Mercenary Tao, rebuilt as a cyborg. Taken over by panic and shock at discovering Gohan is Goku's son, Mercenary Tao flies away on a tree. Goku arrives and he and Gohan are given the groceries by Mr. Lao, who encourages them that they can defeat Cell. Gohan and Goku say their goodbyes to Mr. Lao and Lime and fly back home.<br><br>In another filler episode, Gohan has his 11th birthday and all of his other memories are revealed. One of his memories include Goku, Chi-Chi, and the Ox-King discussing a name for their newborn son. However, when they mention Grandpa Gohan, Goku's deceased adoptive grandfather, they discover the baby laughs at the name, "Gohan." Seeing as the baby likes the name, "Gohan", Goku, Chi-Chi, and Ox-King name the baby, "Gohan." In another flashback Goku, Chi-Chi, and Gohan are walking in the woods when they look up in a tree at a bird family. However, Goku accidentally lets go of Gohan's stroller, causing Gohan to zoom violently down the hill while Goku and Chi-Chi run for their lives after their crying son. The stroller jumps over a ravine and heads for a tree where it crashes and breaks. The crying Gohan is about to smash into the tree, but he stops crying and uses his hidden power to smash through the tree without injury. Goku catches Gohan on the other side of the tree and he laughs, ending the flashback.<br><br>Gohan, Goku, and Krillin return home, where they, along with Chi-Chi and Ox-King, celebrate Gohan's 11th birthday. Before he blows out the candles, Gohan makes a wish in his mind. He wishes he would have enough strength to defeat Cell so his family would live in peace. However, when Gohan blows out the candles, he accidentally ends up blowing the cake everywhere on everybody's face. Chi-Chi says a boy would get severely punished for trashing his birthday cake. However, Chi-Chi's mood changes to happy and she says he can not help it because he is Goku's son, to which everyone joyfully laughs.<br><br>Finally, ten days have passed and the Z Fighters arrive at the Cell Games for the battle against Perfect Cell. Goku is the first Z Fighter to battle against Perfect Cell and matches the monster blow for blow. To everyone's surprise, Goku forfeits the battle against Perfect Cell after using the Instant Kamehameha which left him and Cell drained. Goku then chooses Gohan to fight Perfect Cell in his place. Gohan states Goku and Cell's battle was not hard to keep up with, leading to the conclusion that Gohan was possibly stronger than Goku, who was fighting at full power. Gohan powers up to the point where his power exceeds even Goku's and reluctantly fights Perfect Cell. As the battle occurs, Gohan does not have the same fighting spirit as his father nor does he have the desire to kill, thus allowing Perfect Cell to gain the upper hand. Gohan tells Cell that once he becomes enraged, his hidden power is unleashed, referring to when he attacked Raditz, when he was in training with Piccolo, and when he was fighting Frieza. Gohan did not wish to see this power unleashed, much to Perfect Cell's chagrin.<br><br>Believing he could see this hidden power, Perfect Cell began smacking Gohan around to get him angry. Gohan finally gets a little angry and kicks Perfect Cell in the face, giving him a bloody lip and fueling his desire to see Gohan's hidden power. When things start to get dangerous, Android 16 sneaks up behind Perfect Cell and gives him a bear hug, attempting to self-destruct and take the monster with him. However, Krillin reveals to Android 16 that Bulma and her father removed the self-destruct bomb, allowing Perfect Cell to break free and blast Android 16 to bits, much to the horror of the Z Fighters. However, the android's head is left still intact and rolls over to Mr. Satan and his gang, who were hiding and watching the fight.<br><br>Perfect Cell then creates seven Cell Juniors and has them attack the Z Fighters. Gohan watches in horror and becomes angry as his friends are mercilessly beaten by the Cell Jrs. Meanwhile, the head of Android 16 convinces Mr. Satan to throw his head to where Gohan and Perfect Cell are so that he may help Gohan. Now in Gohan's sight, Android 16 tells Gohan to not be afraid of releasing his anger and that it was okay to fight if he wants to protect the people and world he loved. Finally, 16 said to Gohan to drop his restraints and let it go because he has enough power and strength to defeat Perfect Cell. With Android 16's final words, Perfect Cell crushes Android 16's head, ending the peaceful android's life. Touched by Android 16's final words and enraged by the peaceful android's death, Gohan's rage reaches its limits and transforms him into a new level, Super Saiyan 2.<br><br>Now in his new anger-fueled state, Gohan says to Perfect Cell stating that he will never forget what he has done. He approaches the android and quickly snatches the Senzu Beans that Perfect Cell stole from Krillin. Gohan disappears as Cell tries to grab them back and appears in front of a Cell Jr., showing new amounts of speed. The Cell Jr. attempts to strike Gohan, only to be easily killed by the enraged young Saiyan. Gohan moves so fast that it appears that he has teleported to where Krillin is held captive by two of the Cell Jrs., something that Future Trunks realizes about Gohan increasing his strength and power without losing speed. Gohan rescues Krillin and kills another of the Cell Jrs. Seeing this new incredible power that Goku spoke of earlier, Perfect Cell orders all of the Cell Jrs. to take on Gohan all at once; however, Gohan easily kills all of Cell Jrs. without mercy, much to the amazement and shock of everyone, including Perfect Cell. After Gohan gives the stolen Senzu Beans to Future Trunks to heal the Z Fighters, he proceeds to challenge Perfect Cell.<br><br>As the Z Fighters are healed by the Senzu Beans and get to a safe distance, Gohan battles Perfect Cell and gains the upper hand against the android. Perfect Cell unleashes his maximum power and punches Gohan hard in the face. However, Gohan is barely fazed by Perfect Cell's blow and counterattacks with two powerful punches to his stomach and face, severely injuring the Android. Perfect Cell fires attacks used by some of the Z Fighters, including the Destructo Disc, Special Beam Cannon, and Scatter Shot at Gohan, who easily brushes through the attacks. Gohan tells Perfect Cell that he should not have pushed him and because of that, he is going to destroy him.<br><br>Perfect Cell flies up high into the air and fires a massive Kamehameha down at Gohan in an attempt to destroy the entire Earth. However, just as the huge energy beam is about to hit the Earth, Gohan counterattacks with a bigger and more powerful Kamehameha, overpowering Perfect Cell's Kamehameha and destroying the android's legs, left arm, and the two straight sections on top of his head. Goku yells for Gohan to finish off Cell before he regenerates, but Gohan, still enraged at Perfect Cell's actions, refuses and wants Cell to suffer before he kills him. Surprisingly, Gohan even cracks out a psychotic grin at Goku while Cell is regenerating while Goku continues telling him to finish Cell. As Goku predicted, the enraged Cell regenerates and transforms into his Power Weighted form but even with his enormous power, he is unable to hit Gohan, making the same mistake Future Trunks made ten days ago. After Gohan dodges Cell's punches, he delivered two powerful kicks to Perfect Cell's face and stomach, making him regurgitate Android 18 and transform back into his Semi-Perfect form.<br><br>In a fit of anger and desperation, Semi-Perfect Cell began a Self Destruction technique, planning to blow himself up along with the Earth. Gohan attempts to attack the self-destructing Semi-Perfect Cell, but the android replies that if he is hit, he will immediately explode. Hearing this, Gohan realizes that there is no way that he can save the Earth and blames himself for not finishing Cell off sooner. However, at the last second, Goku uses instant-transmission to transport in front of Semi-Perfect Cell. Goku tells Gohan how proud he is of his son for putting up a good fight and to look after Chi-Chi. After a heart-felt goodbye to his son, Goku transports Cell away from Earth to King Kai's Planet where Semi-Perfect Cell finally explodes, destroying the planet and killing Goku, King Kai, Bubbles, and Gregory in the process. Back on Earth, Gohan and the other Z Fighters mourn Goku's noble sacrifice. Realizing how cocky and arrogant he was, Gohan cries and blames himself for his father's death while Krillin tries to comfort him.[11]<br><br>However, unknown to the Z Fighters, Cell survives the explosion, regenerating from a lone cell in his core. Doing this effectively raised his power higher due to the Saiyan genes he absorbed from Goku and Vegeta, and he also learned Goku's Instant Transmission technique, which he used to head back to Earth. As his first act of return, Super Perfect Cell kills Future Trunks with one blast in front of the shocked Z Fighters. Gohan was in fact pleased to see Super Perfect Cell had returned, hoping to defeat the android so he could avenge his father. Enraged by his son's death, Vegeta in a fit of fury and rage, transformed into to a Super Saiyan and attacked Super Perfect Cell with a powerful barrage of energy blasts. However, as the dust clears, Super Perfect Cell emerges from the blast, unharmed, and smacks Vegeta aside to the ground and fires a powerful blast at the Saiyan prince. Gohan jumps in front of the unconscious Vegeta and takes the full-force of Super Perfect Cell's attack, costing him the use of his left arm and most of his power drained.<br><br>Wanting to end the conflict, Super Perfect Cell prepares a massive Kamehameha to destroy Gohan, who loses all hope after having his left arm broken and seeing how much more powerful Super Perfect Cell is now. However, at that moment, Goku telepathically contacted Gohan with the help of King Kai and encouraged Gohan to believe in his power. When Gohan tells Goku it was all his fault that this happened, Goku reminds him that not only do things like this happen, but if anyone is to blame for it, it is Super Perfect Cell. With new found hope and confidence, Gohan prepares a one-handed Kamehameha with the assistance from Goku's spirit. With their attacks finally charged and ready, Gohan and Super Perfect Cell fire their Kamehameha attacks at each other, resulting in a huge Beam Struggle that knocks everyone away.<br><br>During the Kamehameha duel between Gohan and Super Perfect Cell, Super Perfect Cell has the upper hand against Gohan. However, Gohan, still aided by his father in Other World, is able to charge more of his power into his Kamehameha, seemingly bringing the energy duel to a standstill. The Z Fighters, except for Vegeta, also help out Gohan by blasting Super Perfect Cell, who retaliates by knocking all of them away with his energy, rendering them unable to help Gohan. However, just as Super Perfect Cell is about to destroy Gohan, Vegeta, after regaining his confidence, aims at Super Perfect Cell's head with a Galick Blazer, distracting the android. Seeing this opportunity, Gohan (encouraged by Goku) unleashes all the rest of his power into his Kamehameha, completely destroying every cell in Super Perfect Cell's body, dispatching the android once and for all. Having successfully won, Gohan reverts to his normal state and collapses to the ground, breathing heavily and smiling as Goku in Other World expresses how proud he is of his son for finally defeating Super Perfect Cell and saving the world.<br><br>Following Super Perfect Cell's defeat, the Z Fighters and Gohan return to Dende's Lookout, where he is healed by Dende. With the newly recreated Dragon Balls, they summon Shenron and wish for all of Cell's victims to be revived. However, Goku does not come back and telepathically contacts the Z Fighters on the Lookout. Goku tells them not to revive him and explains that he seemed to attract evil villains that were after him, so the Earth would be safer if he was not there. He also said that Gohan had greatly surpassed him and if there were any other threats, Gohan would be there to defend the Earth. With the conversation over, Gohan and the Z Fighters say their goodbyes to Goku and to each other before leaving Kami's Lookout and going their separate ways, leaving the Earth safe once more.<br><br><h4>Great Saiyaman Saga</h4>
Seven years after the events of the Cell Games, Gohan lives at home with his mother and his seven-year-old brother named Goten, born just after the Cell Games. His training has taken a backseat to his studies and his strength has decreased overtime, although he can still compete with Goku and Vegeta, who have trained hard in those years. Chi-Chi decides Gohan needs to attend high school in order to pursue higher education, so she sends him to Orange Star High School in Satan City. On his first day in the city, he turns Super Saiyan (in order to conceal his identity) to stop a robbery, and by the time he arrives at Orange Star High tales of the newest hero, "Gold Fighter", have already spread (which name was actually given to him after two previous incidents while going to the school to take entrance exams). In class, he meets another crime-fighter and the most popular girl in school, Videl. She is the daughter of Mr. Satan, who got rich and famous for stealing Gohan's credit over the defeat of Cell. While at school, Gohan also had to be careful not to reveal his true power.<br><br>However, Gohan makes the mistake of forgetting to take off his student badge as the "Golden Fighter" and unintentionally performs superhuman feats during PE class, unfortunately earning him unwanted attention from his classmates. Videl is especially suspicious of Gohan and spies on him to see if he is really the Gold Fighter. Videl confronts Gohan several times to voice her suspicions, but Gohan nervously denies them and uses his speed to escape from her spying. Gohan decides to use a disguise when fighting crime and goes to Bulma to make him a costume. While he waits for Bulma to finish his disguise, Gohan greets Trunks, who is being trained by Vegeta to surpass Gohan. When Vegeta appears, Gohan says hello, but the Saiyan prince simply replies to Gohan that he will get rusty if he overlooks his training. After a few hours, Bulma gives Gohan a device resembling a watch to instantly give him a disguise, leading Trunks to comment on how lame Gohan looked while wearing it. Thanking Bulma, Gohan went home. Telling the Flying Nimbus to fly home at maximum speed, Gohan expressed joy that his identity won't be so easily discovered while fighting crime. He uses the name "Great Saiyaman" to hide his identity so that the media will not bother his family.<br><br>However, while trying to convince Videl to let him return a stolen pterodactyl baby to its two pterodactyl parents, he accidentally reveals his identity to Videl, who then blackmails Gohan to compete against her in the newly revived World Martial Arts Tournament in exchange for her silence (In the manga, she very easily tricks Gohan into revealing his identity after stopping some thugs by asking the Great Saiyaman how he left class, and he answers her, revealing that he is actually Gohan). Gohan, having no experience with kids his own age, especially girls, is helpless against the confident Videl, who makes him promise to teach her how to fly.<br><br>At Capsule Corporation, Gohan tells Bulma about how he's being blackmailed into entering the World Martial Arts Tournament by Videl, who saw through his Great Saiyaman disguise. Bulma offers to fix his helmet so it alters his voice, but Gohan points out that he can't wear helmets or armor in the tournament and asks if there was something that could replace the helmet. Bulma comes up with a workaround, replacing the helmet with a bandanna and sunglasses, which unfortunately does little to reduce just how ridiculous the costume is. When Bulma points out that Gohan would have no challenge when he enters the Tournament, Vegeta enters, deciding to compete as well, wanting to see if he's surpassed Gohan by continuing to train while the young half Saiyan has grown complacent. Goku, listening in from the Other World, contacts them and tells them he'll compete too, using his one-day pass to the living world. To make it more interesting, and to give them a chance to meet Goku again, Gohan tells all his friends about the tournament, and they all decide to compete.<br><br><h4>World Tournament Saga</h4>
His first stop is the Kame House, where Krillin lives with Android 18, and their daughter Marron. When Gohan reveals that the top 5 places win prize money, Android 18 quickly badgers Krillin into entering. Next, Gohan heads for The Lookout, where he tells Piccolo, Dende, and Mr. Popo about the upcoming tournament. Piccolo agrees to enter, but Dende refuses, since he's a healer, not a warrior. Gohan doesn't know where Tien Shinhan is, and Bulma would tell Yamcha, so that covers everyone Gohan knows. Gohan then begins to wonder how Chi-Chi would take the news that Goku was coming back, and if she'd even allow him to compete. As it turns out, once he mentions Goku and the prize money, Chi-Chi immediately gives him permission both to compete and to take time off from school to train for it.<br><br>The next day, Gohan's ready to get back to training, with the help of his brother, Goten. Gohan decides to begin his training by going Super Saiyan and practicing his reflexes. He gathers a pile of rocks, draws a line in the dirt, and tells Goten to throw the rocks at him from there. Goten asks if he's sure Gohan wants to start that close, but at Gohan's insistence, Goten throws a rock. Gohan is caught by surprise at how hard Goten can throw, and only manages to barely get out of the way as the rock flies at him, and it slams into the cliff behind him, smashing it. Realizing Goten's a lot stronger than he was expecting, Gohan moves the line further back. Goten starts throwing the rocks again, and Gohan manages to dodge them easily now.<br><br>Eventually, Goten stops throwing the rocks and asks if he can go Super Saiyan like Gohan. Gohan laughs, telling him it would take a long time for him to be strong enough to go Super Saiyan, but then Goten goes Super Saiyan, utterly shocking Gohan to see his younger brother easily break his record as the youngest Super Saiyan ever. Changing his plan, Gohan asks him if he knows martial arts, and Goten tells him that Chi-Chi was teaching him how to fight while Gohan was working on homework. When Gohan asks if Chi-Chi knows Goten can go Super Saiyan, Goten says he showed her once, and she said it made him look like a punk. Knowing that feeling too well, Gohan laughs about it. As they practice fighting, Gohan manages to avoid one of Goten's kicks by flying into the air. Goten calls Gohan a cheater because Goten doesn't know how to fly, stumping Gohan again. Gohan then sees a familiar airplane fly by, and realizes Videl's on her way to his house. Gohan tells Goten not to go Super Saiyan in front of her.<br><br>As they run back to their house, Goten is amazed at how strong Gohan was, but Gohan says Goten could enter the tournament too if he trained hard enough. Goten then tells Gohan that Trunks is even stronger than him, and Gohan starts to get worried that the kids will leave him in the dust if he's not careful. Gohan and Goten return to their house, where they find Videl and Chi-Chi in an argument. Gohan just sighs, saying he only wanted to train quietly. In the wilderness, Gohan begins to teach Goten and Videl how to fly, saying it's just a matter of controlling their energy, however, he learns that Videl has no knowledge of energy, since her father believes it to be just a trick. Goten demonstrates by shooting a Ki Blast and blowing up some rocks. Videl is very confused, so Gohan begins to train her from scratch, though she picks it up pretty quickly.<br><br>After eating lunch with Chi-Chi, Videl has managed to gain enough control of her ki to begin floating, much to Gohan's amazement. Goten, however, has rapidly mastered flight and is flying around freely. Gohan reassures Videl that once she gets some training, she'll be able to fly like him. Videl says she'll come back tomorrow, to Gohan's surprise. Gohan says she's already learned all she needs to, and can learn the rest on her own. Videl says she wants to learn more about Ki, and asks if she's a bother to have around. Gohan says no, so Videl reaffirms that she'll come back tomorrow. Before Videl can leave, however, Gohan suggests she cut her hair short. Videl blushes a bit, thinking Gohan prefers girls with short hair. Gohan obliviously states that it's for practical reasons, since short hair would be better in a fight. Embarrassed, Videl yells that her hair is her business and flies off in her plane. Nevertheless, the next day, Videl returns with her hair cut short. Gohan finds himself confused, not understanding girls at all.<br><br>Videl is shown to be getting really good at ki control, as she's now floating a good ways above the ground. Goten, however, is still flying freely, and Videl wonders when she'll get that good. Gohan says that he doesn't know, so Videl says she'll come every day until she can. Gohan then suggests to Goten that he stop showing off while Videl's around. Videl decides to take a break and tells Gohan not to say anything to her father about her learning to fly, because she wants it to be a surprise. She also doesn't want her father to know that she's going to a boy's house, since he won't let her go out with anybody weaker than him, but since he's the World Champion, she believes everybody's weaker than him. Gohan asks if she's ever practiced with her father, and she says no. Gohan grins, knowing Videl doesn't realize she's a lot stronger than Mr. Satan. Gohan changes the subject, asking if Videl would be disappointed if her father lost. Videl just laughs, saying she'd be glad to see someone knock her arrogant father down a peg, to Gohan's delight. Videl then asks who trained Gohan. Gohan answers that it was an old friend and his father, before he died. Videl asks if his father was strong, and Gohan confirms this. Goten then blurts out that their father is coming back for the tournament, despite Gohan just saying he died. Videl takes it that their father actually divorced their mother, and secretly told them he was coming back for the tournament, but not her. Videl then shrugs the whole thing off and they get back to training.<br><br>After ten days, Videl has developed her flight skills to the point of being able to fly freely, putting an end to her training with Gohan. This allows Gohan and Goten to get serious about their own training to get ready for the upcoming Tournament and their chance to see their father again.<br><br>On the day of the Tournament, the Dragon Team, and their family and friends go the arena in a plane being flown by Bulma. Gohan doubts his father will recognize Krillin with his hair, which makes Krillin chuckle. Gohan then asks Vegeta, Goten, and Trunks not to turn Super Saiyan at the tournament, with Bulma thinking that's a good idea since they'll be on TV and could be recognized from the battle with Cell. Vegeta thinks he could destroy all the TVs, but Gohan says he mustn't. Vegeta relents, though, saying he’ll win either way. The boys are okay with that, too. At the tournament, there's a huge crowd, and they don't see Goku anywhere. Goten then spots Piccolo, and Gohan goes over and asks him if he's seen his father, but he hasn't. Just then, Goku lands, with Fortuneteller Baba beside him. Almost everyone tears up and embraces him in an emotional reunion, and for the first time in his life, Goten meets his father. Piccolo suggests that they all hurry up and sign in. At the registration table, Trunks and Goten are forced to enter the Junior Division for everyone under fifteen.<br><br>At the start of the preliminaries, not including the Junior Division, there are 194 people present but only sixteen can participate. Mr. Satan will participate automatically, since he is the reigning champion, but they'll now pick the remaining fifteen using a Punch Machine. The fifteen highest scores will pass. Mr. Satan demonstrates the punch machine, saying no one can do better than him (Krillin smugly says otherwise). Piccolo telekinetically destroys all of the cameras, and says he did it for Gohan so his high school friends won't find out his true identity, much to Gohan's delight. Gohan splits off from the group to find Videl, just as Mr. Satan prepares to use the punch machine. Goku, Krillin, Android 18, and Piccolo each give it a light tap and get in the 200's of it. Vegeta doesn't hold back at all and when he punches the machine, it is destroyed. Gohan asks Videl how well can she fly now, and she asks him why he isn't shocked that Vegeta destroyed the Punch Machine and how everyone in that group got over 200, and her dad's record was only 139. In the meantime, the rest of the contestants will have to wait for another punch machine, so Goku suggests to Vegeta they go watch the Junior Division. Videl continues wondering about that group, as they come over toward Gohan, with Goku noting that his friend was a girl. Krillin teasingly says she's a very cute girl,. Goku says they're all going to watch Trunks and Goten, and then head off. Videl can't believe Gohan knows them, and he explains that the one in the orange gi was his father. Videl had thought his father was dead, and Gohan says that's why he has the halo above his head, much to her bewilderment.<br><br>The Junior Division begins, while Gohan and Videl are still lined up at the punch machine, unable to watch. Gohan and Videl finally arrive to witness the fight between Trunks and Goten. Goku and Gohan are surprised at how powerful the boys are, but Trunks uses an underhanded tactic to secure his victory over Goten. With Trunks' victory over Goten, he's earned the right to fight Mr. Satan in a special match. Goku, Krillin, Piccolo, Vegeta, and Android 18 walk off, knowing this fight is going to be as one sided as it gets. Gohan chooses to stay, since Videl is shocked they don't want to watch Trunks fight Mr. Satan.<br><br>After the match, Gohan and Videl find Goku and the others eating lunch, and where the Saiyans demonstrate their huge appetites. After finishing up all their food, they head back to draw lots which determine the order in which the contestants will fight. As they walk around, they run into a strange pair: A very tall solemn man and a small man with spiked hair, who's floating. Piccolo and Goku are surprised by their appearance, as Videl comments on the floating. The little man says hello to Goku, explaining that he's heard of him. He has also passed the preliminaries, and hopes to fight against Goku. He doubts he could beat Goku, but he'd love to find out how strong he really is. Then he wants to shake Goku's hand. They shake, and the guy says Goku does indeed have a good soul. The pair heads off, and Goku thinks it won't be so easy for them to win after all. Krillin didn't think anything special of them, though. Piccolo doubts those two were from Earth, but wonders why aliens would be here. Videl asks about this alien business, and Gohan whispers to her that Piccolo's a bit strange, and she believes him because of his complexion. Krillin wants the drawing to hurry up and start. At the drawing, Gohan is pit against Kibito in the fourth match. Goku warns Gohan not to underestimate him.<br><br>As the tournament occurs, Krillin easily wins his match, but Piccolo, is uncharacteristically nervous and forfeits against Shin, much to the others shock. When Videl faces Spopovich in the third match, she is nearly beaten to death by the large brute. Gohan watches in anger as his friend horribly suffers at the hands of the ruthless Spopovich. Despite the pleas of the crowd, Gohan, and even the World Tournament Announcer, Videl refuses to concede defeat. Finally, having seen enough, Gohan turns Super Saiyan and tries to save Videl from Spopovich, but before he can, Yamu interrupts and tells for Spopovich to finish the match because they have much more important things in the matter. Spopovich kicks Videl out of the ring and leaves with Yamu, but not before being told by the angry Gohan that he will win the next time they fight. Goku quickly uses Instant Transmission to head for Korin Tower to get some Senzu Beans. Meanwhile, Gohan takes VIdel to the infirmary, where Mr. Satan arrives shortly thereafter to check on her. Gohan promises to beat Spopovich for Videl. Mr. Satan, hearing this, worries that his daughter is dating a "wuss" like Gohan.<br><br>The announcer informs the crowd that Videl's life is not in danger, and starts to announce the fourth match, but Gohan rushes out to ask him to wait because they're getting a special medicine for Videl. Goku then returns with three Senzu Beans and Gohan asks Kibito to hold on for just a bit longer while he helps Videl. Gohan goes into the medical room and tells Videl to eat the bean, but the doctor protests him giving weird food to his patients. Videl says that since it's Gohan, something strange will probably happen. Mr. Satan tells her not to listen to him and spit the bean out, but she chews it anyway.<br><br>With Videl fully healed, Gohan returned to the tournament and found himself set up to fight Kibito. After his classmates in the stadium cheer for him, Gohan realizes he is completely exposed without his cape and turban, and sighs as he tosses away his sunglasses. In order for Shin and Kibito to find Babidi's spaceship, they are forced into tricking Gohan into turning into a Super Saiyan. However, Gohan states that there is a level beyond a Super Saiyan and transforms into his Super Saiyan 2 form, shocking the audience, while revealing that he was the mysterious Gold Fighter. At that moment, Yamu and Spopovich jump into the ring and Shin paralyzes Gohan when he is about to attack. Yamu and Spopovich steal Gohan's energy, reverting him back to his normal state, and fly off, with Shin and the other Z Fighters in pursuit. Kibito heals Gohan, restoring his energy and explains they are going after Spopovich and Yamu to find Babidi's spaceship. Gohan and Kibito, along with Videl, fly away to meet up with the Z Fighters and the Supreme Kai.<br><br>Kibito tells them a story about a wizard and a demon. Long ago, deep in space, there was a very evil mage named Bibidi. One day, Bibidi created an incredible monster, a demon called "Majin Buu", who had no reason or emotion. He was a creature born only to bring terror and death. In a matter of years, hundreds of planets were destroyed. There were previously five Supreme Kais, who all held the power to defeat someone like Frieza in a single attack, but four of them were killed by Majin Buu, who's ferocity was controlled only by Bibidi. However, Bibidi was soon unable to control Majin Buu and sealed him inside a magic ball to transport him from planet to planet. Bibidi brought the ball to Earth, which was intended to be his next target. Shin waited for this chance, and, before Buu's seal was released, he was able to kill Bibidi. The ball, in which Majin Buu is contained, remained sealed, without being destroyed. Kibito and Shin thought it best to not unnecessarily disturb it. Moreover, the only one who could release the seal was Bibidi. However, just recently, they learned something terrible: Bibidi had a son who is currently on Earth. His name is Babidi, and his purpose is to revive Majin Buu and continue where his father left off. The only way to stop Majin Buu's revival is to stop Babidi. Kibito explains that, in order to resurrect Buu, Babidi needs to collect pure energy. He then admits they knew Spopovich and Yamu would attack Gohan when he transformed into a Super Saiyan, but they needed the attack to occur so they could follow Spopovich and Yamu and find where Majin Buu was hidden.<br><br>After flying for a time, Videl gets tired and decides to head back to the World Tournament, seeing as the opponent they are going to face is too powerful for her. However, before leaving, she and Gohan have a conversation about the identity of the Gold Fighter, who is actually Gohan. Figuring this out, Videl comes to the conclusion that seven years ago during the Cell Games, Gohan was the golden-haired boy who had killed Cell, not Mr. Satan. Gohan and Videl say goodbye to each other and Videl promises that she is not through with him yet, indicating that she has fallen for him. Gohan and Kibito later catch up with Shin and the Z Fighters at Babidi's spaceship. The group lands on a nearby hill, and suppress their Ki so they aren't detected. They watch as Spopovich and Yamu talk to Pui Pui, and realize that Babidi had hidden his spaceship underground, which likely means Babidi knows Shin and Kibito are there. Piccolo suggests they attack before they get a chance to resurrect Majin Buu, but Shin advises them to be patient, saying that Babidi will most likely release Buu outside of his ship. Gohan glances off to the side and spots a slaughtered family nearby, angering him. Just then, Piccolo sees someone coming out of the ship. It is the evil wizard Babidi and Dabura.<br><br>Kibito and Shin panic when they realize that Babidi has taken control of Dabura, king of the Demon Realm. Goku asks if he's the big guy, and Shin says yes. He explains that he's the king of the Dark Demon Realm. In this world, they may be the strongest, but in the Demon World, Dabura is the top. Krillin starts to get worried, as Gohan realizes the smaller one must be the wizard Babidi. Shin says that he may have little physical strength, but Babidi uses incredible magic, enough to make even Dabura his underling. Kibito explains that Babidi takes advantage of the evil in one's heart and controls them via their thoughts. Thus, a demon like Dabura was a suitable choice. That's why only people like them, without evil in their hearts, can fight Babidi. Shin says they really hadn't counted on Dabura being here, and Vegeta asks if they think they can't win. Vegeta says that Majin Buu won't be revived, because he won’t lose to guys like this. Goku tells Krillin he should leave, and he agrees. However, when Yamu and Spopovich give the energy to the evil wizard, Babidi retaliates by killing them. Dabura and Babidi realize the Z Fighters are nearby and decide to steal their energy by killing the weaker fighters and luring them into the spaceship. Dabura flies up to the Z Fighters and kills Kibito with a Evil Impulse blast at point blank range. After a brief fight, Dabura spits on Krillin and Piccolo, turning them to stone, and flies back to the spaceship. Goku asks if there's a way to restore Krillin and Piccolo, and Shin says only if Dabura dies. Goku is glad it’s such a simple method. Goku, Gohan, and Vegeta go after Dabura with a reluctant Shin following behind.<br><br>When they get inside the spaceship, they are told they must defeat the three fighters if they want to destroy Babidi and leave the ship. When the first fighter, Pui Pui, appears, Goku, Gohan, and Vegeta play Rock-Paper-Scissors to see who gets to fight first. In the end, Vegeta wins the game, and steps up to fight Pui Pui. Pui Pui reveals that if they take any damage, it will be converted to energy for Majin Buu. Vegeta effortlessly overwhelms Pui Pui wihout having to transform. In order for his minion to gain an advantage, Babidi teleports the interior of the room to Pui Pui's homeworld: Zoon. However, Vegeta's gravity training made him immune to the increased weight of the planet and Pui Pui was easily slaughtered by Vegeta's Double Galick Cannon. With the defeat of Pui Pui, they can proceed to the next stage. Goku becomes impatient, while Vegeta contemplates just destroying the floor, but Shin insists he mustn't, lest he disturb Majin Buu. Vegeta thinks this Majin Buu is probably nothing special, just like Dabura. Goku agrees, thinking Dabura is probably about as strong as Cell was seven years ago.<br><br>Next at level two, Babidi sends Yakon to obtain energy from the three Saiyans and Goku takes his turn to fight the giant green beast. After a quick fight, Babidi cautiously decides to transfer the warriors to Yakon's homeworld, the Dark Star, so that he could fight at his best. Upon arrival, it is apparent that the name holds up, as the planet is pitch black. Yakon believes he has the upper hand, seeing as how this is his homeworld and that he is apparently nocturnal. However, he soon realized just what he is up against when Goku, despite some surprise at the new environment, easily beats him around. Goku explains that he can feel and sense out Yakon's movements without even needing to see. Nevertheless, Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan, lighting up the surrounding area. Yakon proceeds to suck in Goku's energy, making him revert to his base form. Gohan yells out to his father to not become a Super Saiyan anymore, because the monster eats light energy. Yakon confirms this, but he would still love to have another serving of that great light. Goku sees right through the technique, and allows Yakon to suck in another batch of light energy. Only this time, Goku shows off a hint of his Super Saiyan 2 power and Yakon swallows too much, which obliterates him. With Yakon's death, the four fighters proceed to level three.<br><br>While they wait for the next fighter, Goku asks Gohan if he has trained enough, since his turn is next. Vegeta says that Gohan has gotten weaker in these times of peace and that he and Goku are stronger than him now. Although, Vegeta believes if he were to lose his temper like with Cell, then Gohan could release his full power. Suddenly, the door begins to open and Dabura, the last and strongest of Babidi's fighters, enters the room. Dabura praises them on defeating Yakon and making it to Stage Three, but doubts they can defeat him. Vegeta says Babidi must be getting desperate to send him out so soon. Dabura simply chuckles and tells them all to attack, but Gohan says that he'll be the one to defeat Dabura and demands that Babidi transport them somewhere else. Babidi asks Dabura where he would like to fight, and the demon king replies that he wishes to fight on a world similar to Earth. They are transported to a mountainous range and engage in battle.<br><br>At first, Gohan is fighting a little rusty against Dabura due to not training during the seven years after the Cell Games, but after transforming into his Super Saiyan 2 form, Gohan manages to fight evenly with the Demon King. Dabura begins to use his Evil Flame multiple times, all of which Gohan dodges. When Gohan attempts to hit him, Dabura uses the Afterimage Technique to go further away and hits him with an Evil Impulse blast, which sends the young half-Saiyan into the surrounding water. Gohan flies back up to the surface and throws away his tattered Great Saiyaman clothes, which leaves only his black tights. Gohan flies toward Dabura again, but the demon spits at him. Gohan puts his hand up just in time to block it, so it hits his glove, and he quickly tosses the glove away as it turns to stone. Dabura then magically creates a sword and attempts to cut`Gohan, but the half-Saiyan quickly catches it, and snaps the blade in half. Vegeta becomes disgraced with Gohan's lack of motivation and expresses his frustration, believing Gohan to have peaked in power.<br><br>Blinded by anger, Vegeta says he will end the fight himself, but Goku intervenes, saying that it's still Gohan's turn and he hasn't lost yet. However, Vegeta says that he doesn't care about Babidi or his minions and only wants to sett </div>

<p>
The Superhero Database Classification number, or SHDB Class, is a number that represents the overall 'power' of a character. All traits of a character are used for calculating the Classification.
</p>
<h5>What it DOESN'T mean</h5>
<p>
This doesn't mean that a higher class would always beat a lower class character. But the bigger the difference in Class is, the more obvious it is who'll win in a fight.
</p>
<h5>How is this calculated</h5>
<pre class="footnote">( INT^1.3 + (STR*0.5 )^2 + (SPE*0.5)^2 + DUR^1.6 + (POW + (SPS*SPL))^2 + COM^1.8 ) ^ TIER</pre>
<h6>Super Power Score and Level</h6>
<p>Every Super Power has a score (SPS) that is used to calculate the Class. Each Super Power also has 3 levels (SPL). The level is set when connecting that Super Power to a character. The level determines the final score, of the Super Power, being used in the calculation.
