<h3>Carter Kane's History</h3>
<h4>Early Life</h4>
Carter was born in Los Angeles, California to Egyptologist Julius Kane and his wife Ruby Kane. His younger sister Sadie Kane was born twenty-two months after him. During his sisterâ€™s sixth birthday they got into an argument over who should blow out the candles. During the fight they inadvertently and unknowingly used their magic, causing the cake to explode. Their parents told them that one of them must have punched the cake as a cover up, but neither of them believed that.<br><br><h4>Death of Mother</h4>
When Carter was eight, after his mother died, he traveled all around the world with his dad. His father tried to get custody of Sadie as well, but after six lawyers, two fist fights, and The Spatula Incident, Mr. and Mrs. Faust took sole custody of their granddaughter.<br><br><h4>Living around the Globe</h4>
Following that failure, Carter traveled the world with his father, going to various tombs and places and being forced to dress "impeccably" in dress shirts and khaki pants. Carter could only see his sister twice a year and secretly envied her normal life while she envied his.<br><br>When Carter was ten, he and his father were in Paris when a riot broke out. His father hid him in a nearby car and told him to keep his head down until he said so. After a few seconds the chaos ended with only the father and son left on the street.<br><br><h4>The Red Pyramid</h4>
Six years after the death of his mother, Carter and his father visit Sadie on Christmas Eve and go to the British Museum. There, Julius attempts to summon Osiris but accidentally summons Set, Nephthys, Isis, and Horus as well. Isis takes Sadie as a host and Horus takes Carter. Set, meanwhile, kidnaps Julius, who is now possessed by Osiris. Soon, his uncle, Amos Kane, takes Sadie and Carter to Brooklyn and tells them of their ancestry and that they are magicians. Not long later they are attacked by longnecks and are forced to flee. He and Sadie are able to escape to the First Nome with help from Bast and Zia Rashid. In addition to that, the two learn the basics of magic, but their training is cut short when the late Chief Lector Iskandar dies and is replaced by Michel Desjardins, who orders their execution for hosting gods.<br><br>Sadie and Carter later reunite with Amos and Zia and set out to stop Set. During the final battle, Carter is able to act as one with Horus, and forces Set to realize that he was being controlled by Apophis and, using his secret name, makes Set swear to fight Apophis. Sadie then asks Isis to leave her body and returns to Brooklyn with her brother and uncle.<br><br><h4>The Throne of Fire</h4>
Following the rise of chaos, Carter and Sadie decide to stick to their plan of reviving Ra the sun god by finding and chanting the three sections of the Book of Ra. They choose to isolate themselves from their friends and trainees of Brooklyn House. They have already successfully stolen one of the scrolls by infiltrating the Brooklyn Museum. The second scroll's whereabouts are unknown while the other is claimed to be with Russian assassin Vladimir Menshikov who is targeting Brooklyn House. Before setting off, Carter reluctantly lets Sadie enjoy her birthday in London.<br><br>Carter later adopts a griffin from the Brooklyn Museum, named Freak, as a pet. During a lesson Carter is teaching to the Brooklyn House trainees, Apophis attacks by controlling a monster and threatens to destroy them as he did Zia's village. Carter and the trainees destroy the monster, but Carter is left shaken up by the experience.<br><br>After learning that Sadie is in trouble in London, Carter and Walt travel there through a portal from the museum as their portal at Brooklyn House still needs to cool down from when Sadie used it, and manage to get to Waterloo Bridge. Sadie arrives with Bes and Carter is concerned at first until she explains the situation. Carter sets out with Sadie while Walt and Bes to find a portal to get to St. Petersburg after learning from Sadie that Anubis told her that the second part of the book was there. Walt is left behind at the portal to go back to Brooklyn House for a reason he and Bes refuse to elaborate on, and the Kanes travel to St. Petersburg.<br><br>In St. Petersburg, Sadie and Carter infiltrate Menshikov's lair. Carter and Sadie steal the Book without being noticed and learn that Menshikov is working for Apophis and trying to free him by learning from Set about his prison and Brooklyn House's defenses so he can attack there. Set points out Sadie and Carter to Menshikov and he releases a tjesu heru on them while they release Set. Set holds off Menshikov and Carter battles the monster, losing his khopesh and getting bitten before Sadie destroys it. Set, while claiming the poison to be fatal and incurable, helps Sadie carry Carter out to Bes' car and along with giving up the location of the last part of the Book, tells Sadie to tell Carter that Zia's village is called Al-Hamrah Makan.<br><br>After learning from Jaz's ren and a vision of Isis curing Ra how to cure Carter, Sadie asks Carter for his Secret Name to cure him as his time is nearly up and he reluctantly does so. Learning Carter's secret name allows Sadie to understand him better and she is able to cure him. After explaining what Set told them, Sadie reluctantly tells Carter about what Set said about Zia's village due to Carter's obsession with finding her. Carter realizes the name translates to "The Place of Red Sand" and that it was what Apophis was trying to tell him. Despite it being a trap and the group needing to stick together to find the Book, Carter decides to go find and rescue Zia. Sadie reluctantly agrees, deciding to call upon Walt to help her.<br><br>Carter sets out with Bes to find the village. The two are able to learn the location of the village ruins. Bes warns him that rescuing someone can change the relationship between the rescued and rescuer for the worse. <br><br>They find the ruins covered by the Nile, and when Carter tries to figure out how to part the river as Bes suggests, they come under attack by water demons which Carter destroys with the Fist of Horus. Using the Fist also parts the Nile and they find the entrance to Zia's tomb. Entering the tomb, Carter finally finds the real Zia in a sarcophagus made of water with Ra's crook and flail. Carter frees Zia, but her body starts to reject Nephthys, a goddess that she is hosting, so he and Bes place her in the river and release Nephthys to where she truly belongs. Zia wakens, confused as the only time she truly met Carter was at the British Museum after the gods were released, and although she possess the memories of her shabti, they are more like a movie to her and leave her even more confused. <br><br>Before Carter can talk to her much, Desjardins and Menshikov show up and imprison Bes. They convince Zia that Carter is the enemy. Carter manages to summon the combat avatar of Horus for the first time without hosting the god and battles Menshikov, but loses and starts to be turned into a snake. Luckily, Sadie and Walt arrive through a portal created by Ptah anchored on Bes. The portal breaks Bes' cage and he scares off Menshikov and Desjardins, saving Carter. Zia passes out and the group sets out for Cairo in the Bedouins' truck with Carter falling asleep on the way.<br><br>While asleep, Carter's ba travels to the Hall of Ages where he meets with Horus. Horus tries to convince him to take up the throne of the pharaoh and merge with him again. Carter learns from the vision that Menshikov has gathered an army of magicians and demons to attack Brooklyn House.<br><br>When Carter wakes up, he finds himself in a hotel room and learns that while Zia repeatedly tried to escape, Sadie convinced her to trust them. Zia later offers her aid in defending Brooklyn House, planning to travel there with Walt while Carter, Sadie and Bes enter the Duat to try to find and revive Ra. <br><br>Finally, at sunset, Carter climbs with the others to the top of the Great Pyramid to open a portal into the Duat and discusses his relationship with Zia with her. Zia tells him that while she understands why he did what he did and appreciates it, she needs time to sort things out for herself. After the portal is opened, Bes promises to meet them at the Fourth House of the Night and leaves to help Zia and Walt get to Brooklyn House while Sadie and Carter travel to the Duat, where they find Ra's old sun boat and the gods Nekhbet and Babi. The two gods try to warn them off, but Carter uses Ra's crook and flail to subdue them and make them swear loyalty before sending them away.<br><br>In a bad dream, Carter finds that Brooklyn House is under siege by the House of Life. Walt and Zia leave to Brooklyn to help while Carter, Sadie, and Bes descend into the Duat to find Ra.<br><br>They come across gods and lakes of fire but at a nursery home Bes comes across a woman or hippo from his past, Tawaret the hippo goddess. With her help, they track down Ra and awaken him. When they find Ra, he is senile and a gentle old man acting like a toddler. Yet they find they had already lost and Menshikov had closed the gates to the prison of Apophis and is now loosening the giant snake's bonds. The trio along with Ra come across Carter and Sadie's parents and gamble with the Moon god, Khonsu, for a few extra hours for them to catch up to Vlad. Bes gives up his ren for the two to succeed. Carter and Sadie come face to face with Vlad who is now hosting Apophsis. Desjardins arrives and banishes Apophsis for at least a few more months or even weeks to give the Kanes a little more time, yet dies doing so. Carter and Sadie arrive at Brooklyn house to end the battle. At the end of the battle, Sadie summons the wings of Isis to command the magician's attention, this works and she tells them the story of what happened while they were resurrecting Ra.<br><br>Bes ends up at the nursing home not remembering who he is. Amos becomes Chief Lector and tries leading the magicians into a new age. Sadie vows to cure Bes and Walt. Ra becomes the leader of the gods again. And Zia and Walt are connected to the upcoming war in a big way. <br><br><h4>The Serpent's Shadow</h4>
Carter leads a team to the Dallas Museum to retrieve the Book of Overcoming Apophis by the magician Setne. Carter enlists the help of JD Grissom, the head of that Nome who is dubious at Carter's "crack team." They find the Book, but come under attack by Apophis controlling various creatures in the museum while the magicians of the nome battle Apophis' forces outside. Apophis destroys the Book, but following the advice of a mysterious face that appears to her in the wall, Sadie has the team protect a mysterious golden box. Carter puts up a shield to protect the box, but falters when Apophis tells him his leadership will fail in the end. After Sadie distracts Apophis away from him, Carter nearly collapses from the effort of maintaining his shield and battling with his khopesh to no avail. In the end, Sadie casts Ma'at and drives off Apophis, but nearly dies from the effort. She survives and they discover, to their horror, that Apophis' forces destroyed the Nome and killed all of the magicians including JD and his wife. Blaming himself, Carter sadly has the team fix the museum as much as possible and then uses the nearby Freak to transport themselves and the box home.<br><br>After returning to Brooklyn House, the group discusses with Bast the box which she reveals is King Tut's shadow box and holds one-fifth of his soul. However, Bast is reluctant to talk about it further and Carter adjourns the meeting when he learns that Zia is trying to reach him. Zia discusses with Carter the destruction of the Texas Nome and how the rebels are blaming Carter. Zia explains how the rebels might attack the First Nome, how weak it actually is, and how most of their allies have either been destroyed or defected before she has to go. Later, while Carter is examining the shabti he, Sadie and Walt made of Apophis in case they needed to try an execration to defeat him, Horus arrives possessing a pigeon and tells him that it's a bad idea. The two discuss the idea and Carter asks if Horus has a better idea to which Horus, who admits a limited knowledge of magic, doesn't. Carter instead comes up with the idea to destroy Apophis by execrating his shadow. However, before they can discuss things further, Horus' pigeon can't hold him any longer and he has to leave. <br><br>The next morning, Carter explains his idea to everyone and how he figures that this was what Apophis was hiding by destroying the Book. Carter decides to visit Thoth with Walt after the BAG dance that night to see what he knows.<br><br>At the dance, Carter is forced to dance with Sadie's friend Lacy and is knocked out when Shu arrives to interrupt Sadie and Anbuis dancing. Carter isn't thrilled to learn that she plans to take the Russian magician Leonid to see Amos, but agrees and also agrees to take Walt to see Thoth and to keep him from doing too much magic.<br><br>Carter and Walt take Freak to Memphis to see Thoth and find his pyramid under attack. Carter reluctantly allows Walt to help defend it and in the battle that follows, is shown a vision of his mother and other spirits being dragged towards Apophis' shadow and of Apophis destroying the world. Apophis offers him a deal: hand over Ra and Apophis will spare him and his family. However, before things can go any further, kills Apophis's host and the battle ends. Thoth has Carter and Walt take a nap and when Carter wakes up, he finds that Walt is awake and discussing something with Thoth that Thoth says is dangerous and has never been done before. The two stop discussing it when they see Carter is awake and Thoth reveals that he is under attack so he can't help them out. Thoth tells Carter that a shadow execration could indeed defeat Apophis, but he refuses to tell Carter how to do it or where to find Apophis' shadow, as it is forbidden to talk of such subjects. Thoth instead suggests finding Setne who stole a book he wrote called the Book of Thoth. The book details the location of all the gods' shadows and Setne was able to use it to create a shadow execration. Thoth informs Carter that Setne is on trial at sunset in the Underworld and will be sentenced to destruction, so they only have until then to get his help. Thoth has Carter and Walt leave before sunrise and the next attack and tells Walt to tell Carter something.<br><br>On the ride back, Walt explains that he and Anubis are sure that he will die soon, by sunset of the next day. Carter desperately tries to figure out a way to save Walt and Walt explains that there is a way, but that Carter may not like the side-effects, and that he wants to tell Sadie first.<br><br>At Brooklyn House, the two receive a message from Sadie through a shabti about the upcoming attack on the First Nome. Sadie also informs them of her decision to visit Bes and how she worries that Amos is possibly channeling Set's powers and that Amos may be under Set's control once more. Carter tells Bast to let the children have one last normal day and then to take them to the First Nome, as Amos will need all the help he can get for the upcoming attack and the trainees are the best they have.<br><br>Carter and Walt pick up Sadie and Zia at the House of Rest and Sadie is unhappy with Carter summoning the boat again while Carter is unhappy with her decision to try to restore Bes in the middle of a crisis. However, Zia calms him down by taking his hand and reminding him that he once went off on a personal quest in the middle of a crisis and that turned out well. Upon arrival, Carter orders Bloodstained Blade to wait for them to transport them where they need to go. In the Underworld, Carter and Sadie explain to their father their plan. He also informs him that their only other option will be a normal execration which will kill them and likely not work, and Julius finally agrees, while Zia is horrified. Carter witnesses Setne's trial and works with Sadie to convince Julius to give them custody of the evil ghost to get the Book of Thoth and Apophis' shadow. Setne proposes the plan that they split up: he and Carter and Zia go to get the shadow while Sadie and Walt go to restore Bes. In the end, Julius agrees to give Carter and Zia custody of Setne to capture the shadow and destroy Apophis.<br><br>Carter, Zia and Setne take the Egyptian Queen to get the Book of Thoth and Carter considers telling Zia how he really feels about her before Setne interrupts. Seeing Setne out of the Seven Ribbons of Hathor, the only things controlling him, Carter panics and ties him up again with Setne revealing it was just an illusion. Zia takes Setne to tell Bloodstained Blade where exactly in Memphis, Egypt they have to go to and Set shows up. Carter demands answers, but Set assures him that he isn't controlling Amos and that Amos actually summoned him and sent him to explain things to Carter. Set explains that while he is the God of Evil, he is also the "loyal opposition" and he isn't on Apophis' side. Set warns him of an upcoming attack before disappearing.<br><br>After Set disappears, a monster hippo attacks, sent by Apophis, and Carter refuses to listen to Setne's suggestion of how to deal with the problem, sure that it's a trick. Carter battles the hippo but loses his khopesh and is nearly crushed in his combat avatar before he finally listens to Setne and casts a spell that summons Hapi, the god of the Nile. Hapi dispatches the hippo and helps Carter, Zia and the badly damaged Egyptian Queen safely ashore. After Hapi asks how he can help further, Carter has Hapi transport them to the serapecum where the Book of Thoth is. Hapi transforms them into liquid to transport them and warns Carter that it's a trap.<br><br>At the serapecum, Carter helps disable various traps and learns the story of the Apis Bulls which were entombed there, and is shocked to learn that Setne is actually the son of Ramesses the Great, which makes him a relative of Carter's on his mother's side. Setne leads them to a statue of the Apis Bull and explains that in order to reach the Book, the Bull has to come to life and Carter and Zia have to distract it so he can reach the Book hidden under it. The Bull chases Carter and Zia through the serapecum maze before, to Carter's shock, Zia summons the power of Ra and incinerates the Apis Bull. She nearly explodes before Carter calms her down. Carter, joined by Setne with the Book, carries Zia back to the Egyptian Queen where he gives Setne permission to give Bloodstained Blade orders so he can tell the demon where to go and Carter can take care of Zia.<br><br>Setne betrays Carter and orders Bloodstained Blade to take them to the Land of Demons where the shadow is, but to also kill Carter and Zia. Carter casts a protection spell on Zia and battles Bloodstained Blade, but is at a disadvantage as he can't summon his avatar on the boat and he is unable to summon his khopesh back to him. After spotting Setne trying to escape with the Book of Thoth, Carter ties him up again and he falls into the River of Night. Carter tries to get Horus to send him a weapon, but due to Horus' powerlessness in that part of the Duat, he only succeeds in sending him an ostrich feather. When Carter tries again to summon a weapon from the Duat, to his and Horus' shock, he ends up with the crook and flail of Ra which are supposed to be with Ra. Carter is still nearly killed due to being unsure how to properly use the weapons and his injuries, but Zia recovers and incinerates Bloodstained Blade. The Egyptian Queen crashes and is destroyed, but Carter and Zia survive thanks to Zia turning one of her amulets into a giant vulture which slows their descent to the beach.<br><br>On shore, Zia heals Carter's injuries with Nefertum's Balm and the two leave Setne to struggle ashore while they have a make-shift picnic on the beach of the Land of Demons. They discuss how when Zia channels Ra's power it tends to cause her to black-out and its happening more and more frequently. Zia confides in Carter that Ra's mind is trapped inside his senile body and its struggling to break free through her and that she doesn't think she's strong enough to handle it. Carter realizes that Ra has chosen Zia as his host and figures that if Zia becomes Ra's host, he might finally be reborn. The two discuss their food and the date Carter promised Zia's shabti at the mall, and Zia tells him she wishes they could have their date right then and kisses him to his shock. Zia explains to him that she fears losing him if she gets close to him as she has lost everyone else she cares about. Carter tries to give her the crook and flail, but she declines, saying that they must have appeared to Carter for a reason. Drawn back to reality by the sound of Setne's struggling, Carter and Zia loosen his bonds to get the Book of Thoth and realize that while the Book says that Apophis' shadow is in the Land of Demons, they need Setne's help to interpret it. Setne claims that he knew they'd triumph over Bloodstained Blade and that he can help them sneak through the Land without being seen and find the shadow. They reluctantly agree.<br><br>Setne uses an illusion to make Carter and Zia appear to be demons and guides them through the Land of Demons. The three make their way to the edge of the Sea of Chaos, protected from being killed by the power of Chaos by the amulet Zia is wearing with the last beetle of Khepri on it. Zia realizes that the spell to summon the shadow is a simple summoning spell and that Setne lied to them, but Setne claims that it is complicated for him as he is a ghost and can't cast many spells. Zia summons the shadow, but Setne ties them up and mocks Carter for the trust he placed in him after being betrayed so much and explains his plan to capture the shadow and blackmail Apophis into doing his bidding with it. Carter and Zia are saved when Sadie shows up through a portal and ties Setne back up.<br><br>While relieved to see Sadie, Carter realizes from the fact that Walt isn't with her and her reaction when he asks that Walt must be dead. Carter is also hesitant to allow Sadie to capture Apophis' shadow, worried that something will go wrong and she will die, but ultimately allows it. Sadie captures the shadow, but an army of demons summoned by it shows up to attack them. However, an army made up of the old gods from the House of Rest arrive, led by Tawaret and Bes. Setne, however, escaped during the scene. Bes transports them to the shore of the River of Night where Carter points out that the Egyptian Queen is destroyed and they have no boat. However, Ra arrives in his sun boat on his nightly journey and picks them up. On board, Zia allows Ra to take her as his host and he is finally reborn, but having Ra inside the girl he loves freaks Carter out. He and Sadie discuss what happened and Carter realizes that Walt allowed Anubis to use him as a host to survive and points out to Sadie that she can now be with both guys she likes without problems, while she helps him realize that he shouldn't avoid Zia because she is now hosting Ra. The sun boat arrives in the mortal world at dawn as Apophis rises and the rebels attack the First Nome and they discover Bast single-handedly holding off Apophis. Ra heads to battle Apophis, but tells Carter that it is Carter as pharaoh who is the leader of the gods in this fight, and that Ra only came back to fight Apophis. Ra has Carter keep the crook and flail and Carter merges once again with Horus and flies to the First Nome as falcon, joined by Sadie, merged with Isis, as a kite.<br><br>At the First Nome, Carter helps the initiates battle their way through the rebel magicians into the Hall of Ages where Amos, merged with Set, is battling Sarah Jacobi, Kwai, and her elite soldiers. However, the rebels overcome Amos and use him as a hostage to try to end the battle. Carter and Sadie aren't in agreement with their gods over the course of action and as a result un-merged with them. When Sadie is blasted by Jacobi, Carter tries to go to her aid, but is blasted himself by Kwai with a bolt of red lightning. However, when Sadie is nearly killed, Walt/Anubis quickly dispatches Jacobi and with Jaz's help, Carter quickly recovers and rallies the magicians, both good and rebel against Kwai. After Kwai sacrifices himself to bring down the Hall after being defeated by Walt/Anubis, Sadie saves the Hall with Ma'at. Carter, at Amos' request, takes on the role of Pharaoh of the House of Life and rallies the magicians to his cause. After telling them to wait for his signal, Carter travels as a ba to the throne room of the gods where he calls upon the gods to aid him. To his disappointment, none of the gods he's friendly with show up due to their own troubles and among the gods that do show up are Nekhbet, Babi, Shu, Serqet, Khonsu, Neith and Hapi, most of whom he and Sadie have had troubles with before. Using the authority granted to him by Ra and proving his power, Carter is able to rally the gods to battle and they join the magicians and the other gods in battling Apophis.<br><br>Finding that Apophis splintered the Duat into many different layers so that his enemies had to fight him separately, Carter and Zia make their way through it to try to reach Ra's side who is fighting Apophis' true head, but is growing weaker while the Serpent grows stronger. However, upon reaching Ra afterwards, they inadvertently distract her and Apophis finally succeeds in swallowing him and Zia, enraging Carter so much he goes temporarily insane, attacking Apophis by himself with his crook and flail, nearly exhausting his magic, but creating three gashes on Apophis' neck that don't heal, unlike the rest of his injuries. The loss of Ra causes the sun to disappear and cracks to spread across the desert, and both gods and magicians to falter in despair.<br><br>Carter is affected by this too and loses his merge with Horus again, becoming just Carter once more. However, Bast and Bes are unaffected and demand what his plan is since he is now the leader of the remaining forces, but Carter is too depressed to come up with anything. However, seeing the fireball that is Ra slowly being consumed causes Carter to get angry and he breaks through his despair to ask Sadie about the shadow which she still has. Apophis tries to get them to stop by telling them that the spell won't work when he's at his strongest and they are so weak that they will likely die, which Carter realizes that even with the aid of Horus and Isis, is likely true. However, Carter decides to do it anyways. Carter asks Bast and Bes to distract Apophis so they can cast the spell and both agree. With the two gods distracting Apophis, Carter and Sadie, with Horus and Isis lending them their power and shielding them from Apophis as best they can, start the spell despite knowing it will likely kill them. As he cast the spell, Carter finally understands the true nature of a person's shadow, that it was more than a "back-up disk" for the soul, that it actually stood for a person's legacy and impact on the world, causing him to realize that destroying Apophis' shadow would thus cut his ties to the mortal world and he would never be able to rise again even if he survived. Carter and Sadie succeed in casting the spell, destroying the shadow and Apophis starts to die. As he does, he tells them that they have also pushed the gods away by killing him and starts saying he will devour Ra and take him with him, but Ra and Zia, separated, emerge from Apophis, causing his head to explode. Apophis' influence on the Earth is shattered and the souls that he consumed, including Carter's mother, are released as Apophis dies. Horus leaves Carter without a goodbye and Ra confirms that the gods are leaving the Earth for a long time, but asks Carter to look after Zia for him and tells Carter and Sadie that he owes them his life, refusing the crook and flail when Carter offers them back.<br><br>After the battle, Carter takes Zia to the healing room of the First Nome where his broken hand is fixed and he stays until he is kicked out. As he wanders through the halls watching people arrive from other Nomes to celebrate, Setne arrives to congratulate him and disappears before Carter can recapture him. Making his way through the Nome with Sadie, Carter encounters a few of his and Sadie's trainees and is amused by their stories and excitement. In the Hall of Ages, Carter is offered the throne of the pharaoh and he accepts, becoming the first pharaoh in thousands of years. However, Carter leaves command of the House of Life in the hands of Amos while he runs the Nome at Brooklyn House and finishes high school.<br><br>Afterwards, Carter and Sadie travel to the Hall of Judgement where they find everyone partying to celebrate the destruction of Apophis. Carter is happy and relieved to find his mother there, having survived because they destroyed Apophis in time before she was fully consumed. While Carter is worried about Julius' reaction that they lost Setne, Julius tells them not to blame themselves and that he expected it to happen. Carter also sees JD and his wife and is happy to see them so happy, but still feels immense guilt over his role in their deaths. Later, Carter and Sadie visit the House of Rest to discover that many of the gods there have returned to their previous positions and many that had apparently faded from existence reappeared when they were needed again to help Carter, Sadie and Zia in the Land of Demons. They say their goodbyes to Bes and Tawaret, who are now together, and visit Bast, who can't return with them, and shows them footage of Horus becoming pharaoh again. Carter thinks Horus ripped off his own acceptance speech and abandoned him when he didn't need him anymore, but Bast tells him that what Horus does will mirror Carter, as both are the pharaohs now and that Carter shouldn't take what Horus did personally, that a god wouldn't just discard somebody like that and Horus simply had to leave. After saying a final goodbye to Bast, Carter and Sadie return to Brooklyn House where they find Walt/Anubis waiting for them, and Carter leaves them alone with Sadie.<br><br>Two weeks later, Carter picks Zia up for their promised first date at a mall and takes her to the Mall of America, the largest mall in the United States. Zia is amazed at the mall while several nearby guys are jealous and confused that a guy like Carter got a girl like Zia. Zia informs Carter that Amos suggested she take some time away from the First Nome now that he has everything under control and try to be a typical teenager. Zia reveals that Sadie invited her to stay at Brooklyn House and attend American school and she asks his opinion on the matter. Carter stutters out his acceptance and Zia tells him to shut up, then kisses him.<br><br><h4>The Son of Sobek</h4>
A giant crocodile has been terrorizing Long Island along with other magical disturbances in the area. Carter Kane goes to investigate survey the area. After settling down on the ground, Carter is left behind as his griffin, Freak, flies away with his floating boat. Forced to find the monster, Carter goes into a lake to start his search. Suddenly, the crocodile comes from underwater and swallows Carter whole. Carter plans on using a "word of power" to escape when the crocodile spits him out after it is jabbed in the rear end by Percy. The crocodile soon runs away.<br><br>Carter picks himself up and sees the other teenager in the mud. As Carter examines the "camper boy," he soon realizes that he can clearly see his wand and khopesh, something most mortals are unable to see. He also notices the strange sword that the teen carries, which is a double edged blade. Carter has no idea who this person is, only that everything about him seemed un-Egyptian.<br><br>The teen tries to get Carter to thank him for rescuing him from the crocodile, but Carter is somewhat embarrassed and ends up getting angry at Percy's comments instead. The two then get into a small argument over the ownership of the monster, with Percy thinking that the monster is Carter's pet after he said it was his monster, but only meant he was chasing it. Percy then asks Carter if he is a son of Ares as he must be a half-blood of some kind. He also asks why his sword is all bent, but Carter tells him it is supposed to be like that. Carter also gets angry at Percy's use of the word half-blood (as his dad is African-American and his mom is white), as well as Percy offering to help because Carter was nearly eaten by the crocodile.<br><br>Carter accidentally uses the "Fist of Horus" to cause a fist to knock Percy right out of his shoes and into the swamp. Carter instantly rushes over, thinking he might have killed Percy, but is hit in retaliation by a huge wave of water. Percy lunges at Carter with his sword and Carter is forced to defend himself, not able to attack because of Percy's skills with a sword. During the fight, Percy accuses him of being a monster, which Carter says he is not. Percy also asks if he is an escaped spirit from the Doors of Death or if the monster was his pet and Carter was just trying to find it.<br><br>The fight ends when Carter uses a magic rope to tie Percy's sword to his head just as Percy hit his arm, causing Carter to bleed. During the small break, Percy comments that Carter must be a half-blood because if he was not, the sword would have passed right through him. Percy also asks if he was a rogue demigod who used to be part of Kronos' Army. After listening to Percy talk for a bit, Carter starts to realize that Percy is not a magician and is something completely different, as Percy keeps using words related to Greek mythology. The two form a truce so that they can go after the crocodile, as it has been terrorizing Long Island for weeks now. The two also introduce each other, eventually revealing their names. They eventually find the crocodile terrorizing a small cul-de-sac. Carter sees a gold necklace around the crocodile's neck and tells Percy that they need to remove it to stop the monster, as it cannot be killed. Percy tells Carter to distract the crocodile so that he could get it. Carter makes a large avatar of Horus around himself (which Percy calls a giant glowing chicken-man) and attacks the monster. Percy then jumps on the crocodile and tries to unlock the necklace, but cannot as he is not a magician. As Carter's avatar fades and the crocodile crashes into a house, Carter and Percy switch places. Percy creates a massive whirlpool in the center of the cul-de-sac using the water generated by the crocodile. The crocodile is swept up in it and Carter manages to make it to the necklace. As Percy begins to tire, Carter finally manages to remove it and the creature transforms into a baby crocodile.<br><br>Percy and Carter run off with the baby crocodile after hearing some cop cars approaching. Resting at a nearby diner, Percy and Carter watch the news, as they report that a freak sewer incident had destroyed the homes in the cul-de-sac. Carter and Percy wonder if someone is trying to bring them together to cause trouble and agree to keep their respective worlds a secret from each other until the time is right. Carter takes the necklace and the baby crocodile with him, but places an enchantment on Percy's hand so that if he ever needs to contact him, all he has to do is say his name. The two part on good terms, but Carter knows that some day, he'll wake up to the sound of Percy calling him.<br><br><h4>The Staff of Serapis</h4>
Though he does not make an appearance, he is mentioned a few times by Annabeth and Sadie.<br><br><h4>The Crown of Ptolemy</h4>
Carter and Sadie arrived to Governor's island to help Percy and Annabeth stop Setne from becoming a god. They head south and decide to combine Greek and Roman magic to defeat Setne. Carter uses Annabeth's hat to sneak up on Setne and cut his hand off before he got the crown and escaped. The four devise a plan where Percy hosts Nekbet to distract Setne while Carter, Sadie and Annabeth perform a spell to trap him. During the spell Carter is badly hurt. After Percy fought Setne, Carter was seen with a bandaged head and completed the spell trapping him in a snow globe. After the picnic he takes Setne back to Brooklyn house to use as a paper weight and send the crown to the first nome. He then explains that Sadie knows his secret name before she has Carter slap himself. Carter and Sadie then turn in to a falcon and kite respectively and fly off. </div>

<p>
The Superhero Database Classification number, or SHDB Class, is a number that represents the overall 'power' of a character. All traits of a character are used for calculating the Classification.
</p>
<h5>What it DOESN'T mean</h5>
<p>
This doesn't mean that a higher class would always beat a lower class character. But the bigger the difference in Class is, the more obvious it is who'll win in a fight.
</p>
<h5>How is this calculated</h5>
<pre class="footnote">( INT^1.3 + (STR*0.5 )^2 + (SPE*0.5)^2 + DUR^1.6 + (POW + (SPS*SPL))^2 + COM^1.8 ) ^ TIER</pre>
<h6>Super Power Score and Level</h6>
<p>Every Super Power has a score (SPS) that is used to calculate the Class. Each Super Power also has 3 levels (SPL). The level is set when connecting that Super Power to a character. The level determines the final score, of the Super Power, being used in the calculation.
