<h3>Buffy's powers and abilities</h3>
<h4>Slayer Enhancement</h4>
Buffy is a Slayer and has the enhanced powers than that of what other slayers do.<br><br><h4>Superhuman Strength</h4>
Slayers are endowed with strength greater than that of humans (barring mystically or genetically enhanced), some demons and the majority of vampires. Buffy can also lift the Troll gods Hammer, which is one of the few weapons that could leave any lasting damage on the God Glorificus. <br><br><h4>Superhuman Speed</h4>
Slayers are able to move faster and react more quickly than normal human beings. Outmaneuver all sorts of bullet-fire from multiple ranges and setting off a bear trap, but not getting caught in it.<br><br><h4>Superhuman Agility</h4>
A Slayer is capable of superhuman feats of agility. She can leap to great heights, the maximum being unknown, <br><br><h4>Superhuman Reflexes</h4>
Slayers are able to move faster and react quicker than normal human beings. Buffy has been shown snatching a crossbow bolt in mid-flight. She also can dodge bullets, as well as cars. <br><br><h4>Superhuman Endurance</h4>
A Slayer's body is substantially more durable and resistant to blunt force trauma than an ordinary human's. It is difficult, though not impossible, to bruise them, break their bones or strain their joints, Buffy could take blows form a magically enhanced witch, as well as a God, and able to catch the same Gods hand I’m mid swing, the aforementioned God has proven to destroy buildings with one stomp. <br><br><h4>Accelerated Healing</h4>
Despite this durability to blunt force, a Slayer's skin can be punctured by sharp weapons such as knives or bullets, but they recover from even very severe injuries in remarkably short periods of time. Usually, Buffy is completely healed within 24 hours of being injured, though more serious injuries have been shown to take at least a few days. Buffy has survived contact with a live electrical wire; the normally lethal jolt simply renders her unconscious.<br><br><h4>Slayer Precognition</h4>
Buffy also seems to possesses an enhanced type of slayer precognition that warns her of impending danger through her dreams. For example, her dreams warned her of both her death by the hands of the Master and Angel's death; soon after, Angel lost his soul and reverted to Angelus, holding true to her vision. Later on in the series Buffy dreams of Faith, she talks to her and finds a way to defeat the Mayor through her vision.<br><br><h4>Slayer Sense</h4>
Slayers possess a heightened awareness of their surroundings. This heightened awareness can, with experience, allow the Slayer to know the position of an attacker and fight them blindfolded or in the dark. This is not a constant ability, however. This skill must be honed through practice and the Slayer usually must focus to achieve the full benefit. A Slayer also has the limited ability to detect the presence of vampires. This power must be honed as with the heightened awareness, and the Slayer must focus to achieve the full effect. This does not prevent Buffy (and other Slayers) being ambushed by Vampires. Buffy is unusually deficient in this sense.<br><br><h4>Slayer Collective Memories</h4>
Like all Slayers, within Buffy's "dreamspace" are a collective of inherited slayer memories and prophecies. All Slayers through the ages share a psychic link, manifested in dreams. A Slayer will frequently dream of herself as a Slayer in another time and place. These dreams are usually vague, but can also be prophetic. Dreams exist in their own mystic plane or "dreamscape" where for a Slayer, precognitive sense and the inherited memories of other Slayers can manifest themselves. Also, Slayers have been shown to appear in each other's dreams, and Buffy and Faith shared a dream while Faith was in a coma.<br><br><h4>Sleep-Induced Mystical Protection</h4>
In Season Eight, Xander comments that Buffy has some degree of mystical protection over her now, at least while she sleeps. To that end, her protection means even daggers split apart so as not to pierce her skin.<br><br><h4>Mystical Link with Willow</h4>
Buffy's connection to Willow is now so strong, that even when unconscious, Willow's consciousness can (at will) channel an amount of her power through Buffy.<br><br><h4>Collective Slayer Powers</h4>
Due to the spell willow, Giles and Xander casted on Buffy, she can now collect the powers of the spirits of past slayers which enhance her strength, this also was shown when she took all the powers from the activated slayers, she also had twilight enhancement, which granted her a level of invulnerability, telescopic vision, and even higher strength, speed, agility, and reflexes, she was able to flip a train with one hand. <br><br>She also can also make force fields, and able to burn bullets in season four, as well as turn a rocket into Doves. It’s unsure if she can tap into these powers on command or if they need to re do the spells, but it’s been shown to be on more than one occasion<br><br><h4>Fire Resistance</h4> <br><br>After her resurrection Buffy was able to Touch fire during the Episode <em> Once More With Feeling </em> and she said it felt cold to her, and that her skin should crack and burn, but it didn’t, also during the Dance off, when facing the demon, spinning caused a normal human to burn up in flames instantly. It showed that Buffy could spin much much longer than him, it unknown how long she could have gone since spike stopped her. <br><br><h4>Magic Resistance</h4>
It’s shown through the series and the comics, Buffy has some weird mystical protection, though in the series, without the scythe magic could still effect her, but the effects weren’t as serious and the took longer to effect her than most people, also it shows that Willow was much stronger than Buffy, but Buffy still was able to take her on Because of her magic resistance, due to Willow doing magic on herself to make herself stronger. <br><br>With the scythe Buffy is able to cut through magic, <br><br><h4> Semi-Invulnerable</h4>
Buffy’s skin has shown to be someone impervious to slashes, shown when the paralysis demon slashed her with his claws and it only cut her shirt. <br><br><h4> Mind Control Resistance</h4>
It’s shown in <em>Prophecy Girl</em> that Buffy is immune to hypnosis from vampires, as well as from witches,, it showed that demons weren’t able to locate her in <em>Angel.</em>
<h4>Emotional Power Up</h4>
It’s shown that Buffy uses her love for her friends and her closeness with them to enhance her fighting capability, other slayers haven’t lived much as long because most of them are sheltered from the world. But Buffy’s love for her friends, and Family, give her something to fight for. Enhancing her capabilities.

<p>
The Superhero Database Classification number, or SHDB Class, is a number that represents the overall 'power' of a character. All traits of a character are used for calculating the Classification.
</p>
<h5>What it DOESN'T mean</h5>
<p>
This doesn't mean that a higher class would always beat a lower class character. But the bigger the difference in Class is, the more obvious it is who'll win in a fight.
</p>
<h5>How is this calculated</h5>
<pre class="footnote">( INT^1.3 + (STR*0.5 )^2 + (SPE*0.5)^2 + DUR^1.6 + (POW + (SPS*SPL))^2 + COM^1.8 ) ^ TIER</pre>
<h6>Super Power Score and Level</h6>
<p>Every Super Power has a score (SPS) that is used to calculate the Class. Each Super Power also has 3 levels (SPL). The level is set when connecting that Super Power to a character. The level determines the final score, of the Super Power, being used in the calculation.
