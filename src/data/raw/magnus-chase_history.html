<h3>Magnus Chase's History</h3>
<h4>Early Life</h4>
Magnus was born on January 13, to Frey, the Norse Vanir God of Summer and ruler of Alfheim, and Natalie Chase, a mortal. Natalie and Frey met at the Blue Hills and had a summer fling, and he destroyed her at Stone skipping. Natalie had good memories of Frey and had no hard feelings when they broke up. She said her relationship with him was perfect, except that she didn't have her son yet, She found out she was pregnant with Magnus soon after, and was elated. She had no pictures of him and never revealed his identity to Magnus. When Magnus was born, she named him after a Swedish king.<br><br><h4>Childhood</h4>
When Magnus was six years old, he attended thanksgiving at the Chase Mansion, with his mother, his uncle Frederick Chase, his other uncle Randolph Chase, and his cousins, including Annabeth Chase. The three Chase siblings got into an argument and he and Annabeth hid in the library, while the others argued. They played with dominoes, which were actually Runes, and Annabeth made a model of the Parthenon with them. Annabeth told him he was lucky he lived with his mom, and said she was going to run away. Frederick then came and took Annabeth, saying he was leaving, and she told Magnus to be safe. After the thanksgiving, his mother told him to stay away from Randolph, and to never give him what he wants. Magnus never learned what they argued about, but he never saw his uncle for another nine years. His mom would only mention him when they were riding past his house, and she would tell him to avoid it.<br><br>Years before he became an einherjar, Magnus suffered from asthma and would have asthma attacks, feeling like an invisible belt was constricting around his chest. His mom would hold him while they happened. She would take him outside, which helped him. His mom also made his room as plain as possible, because it was hard for him to sleep indoors unless he had total darkness and no distraction.<br><br>When Magnus was eight, he and his mother went on a vacation to Mount Washington in New Hampshire where they hiked to the top and had a park ranger take their picture. In the second grade, he had a teacher who taped his left hand to his desk in order to force him to write with his right hand, this caused his mother to yell at his teacher.<br><br>When Magnus was ten, his mother had started dating a hunter who taught Magnus how to skin animals. Magnus had cut his left palm in a failed attempt at using a hunting knife, which left a deep scar. His mother got extremely angry at the hunter for causing this incident, and broke up with him soon after.<br><br>That same year, Magnus and his mom went hiking in the blue hills. They stopped at Houghton's pond to skip stones across the River, and his mom beat him with four stone skips when Magnus only got three. She told Magnus a bit about his dad, saying she met him there, on a summer day just like that. Magnus asked her what happened to him, and Natalie said that's why she brought him there, and said he was all around them. Magnus was confused, and she ruffled his hair and raced him to the beach.<br><br>At age twelve, Magnus had his first kiss with a girl named Jackie Molotov, which happened behind the bleachers at a school dance. Years later, he thought it was sad that it was his only kiss, and that it reminded him of getting mouth to mouth from a goat.<br><br>Magnus's mom taught him survival skills, how to navigate, camp, and make a fire, and every weekend, she would take her Subaru and drive to parks, mountains, and lakes. A few months before she died, she was in a hurry. Magnus didn't want to go out that weekend, but she insisted and said they needed to make the most of their time together, as if she was preparing for her death.<br><br>Magnus went to a public high school in Allston for a few months before he dropped out due to his mom's death. On his first day, he was overwhelmed by the hallways at school and thought they were chaos, and that the cafeteria was like a piranha's den.<br><br><h4>Life on the Streets</h4>
When Magnus was fourteen, his mother was murdered by several "wolves with glowing blue eyes" (sent by Fenris Wolf). His mother ordered him to stay away from his Uncle Randolph before her death, an order which Magnus dutifully obeyed. Since then, he has been living on the streets. Magnus became friends with two homeless people: Hearth and Blitz.<br><br>During this time he would frequently lie to the police and truant officers about his name and has tried alcohol. Magnus would also steal money from people passing by, but only if they did things like park in a handicap parking space or were rude to others. He would also pick up barbering skills during this time. He became close friends with the owner of Fadlan’s Falafel, Abdel Fadlan and his son Amir, although he told them his name was Jimmy to protect his identity. At one point he briefly encountered Alex Fierro, a fellow Norse demigod, at a shelter on winter street.<br><br><h4>The Sword of Summer</h4>
While sleeping under a bridge, Magnus is woken up by Blitz, who warns him of the flyers going around that feature both his name and face. Magnus immediately senses something is wrong and, as a precaution, packs his sleeping bag. He learns that these strangers are in fact his cousin and uncle, Annabeth and Fredrick Chase.<br><br>After overhearing their conversation, Magnus learns that his Uncle Randolph told them that Magnus had been missing for two years, but didn't tell Annabeth and Fredrick until now. Magnus also learns that his life was now endangered, which was why they were looking for him. Magnus decides to visit his Uncle Randolph's place to search for answers. While searching in his office, Uncle Randolph comes up behind Magnus and tells him that his life is in danger and that he needs to quickly come with him to escape somewhere. Magnus agrees after he hears loud bangs that are slowly getting closer to the house.<br><br>Once in the car, Randolph reveals that the Norse gods are real and that Magnus is the son of one. They reach a pier where Randolph tells him to call a sword that has been stuck in the water for years and claim it as his own. Magnus successfully retrieves the sword, but is attacked by Surt, who wants to destroy Magnus and take the sword. Blitz and Hearth intervene before Surt can attack Magnus, but quickly succumb to his powers. After seeing his friends hurt, Magnus decides to attack Surt himself. While protecting those on the pier, Magnus make a last stand and manages to toss Surt, along with himself, into the Charles river. Magnus dies of the impact and a chunk of molten tar Surt threw into his gut earlier in the battle.<br><br>Magnus wakes up in a courtyard perfectly okay, with his clothes cleaned and no sign of injuries. When attempting to leave the room, the doorman Hunding comes to get him. Magnus is taken to the front desk where he meets Helgi, the hotel manager, who tells him he'll be staying in Hotel Valhalla forever or until Ragnarök. Hunding takes Magnus to his new room and tells him that his Valkyrie will come for him.<br><br>His Valkyrie, Samirah al-Abbas, walks in and introduces herself and tells him she is taking him to dinner where all the other heroes are. The two walk down to dinner where Magnus's death is shown, though it is edited to look like he died in a murder-suicide. The Thanes debate this while Sam defends Magnus until the Norns appear and recite a prophecy to him while showing him the Feru, the symbol of Frey. After the Norns leave, the Thanes debate and dismiss Samirah as a Valkyrie.<br><br>Once Magnus is back in his room, he showers and finds a note from Thomas Jefferson Jr. that tells him to come to the lounge for breakfast. Magnus goes to breakfast to meet the rest of his hall mates. Once meeting them, they explain that he can leave the hotel, but it's not recommended because he would freak out people in the human world. After breakfast they all head down to training together where Magnus sticks with his hall mates and desperately tries not to get killed. Once T.J., Halfborn, and X have been killed, the rest of the Einherjar gang up on Magnus, who lets out a scream that disarms most of them. Moments later he is hit in the face with an ax and dies.<br><br>Later, Blitz and Hearth fall out of a tree outside of Magnus' window. The two tell him they were watching him, keeping him safe, and that they need to get him out of the hotel. An alarm goes off, signaling the giant squirrel has found them. While running away from the squirrel, the trio go down the recycling chute that takes them back to Midgard. The three end up at Fenway Park, where Blitz tell Magnus that their boss told them that he was a son of Frey and to watch him. They give Magnus his obituary and tell him his funeral is tonight, to attempt to find the sword he died with.<br><br>When they reach the funeral home Hearth stands watch while Magnus searches for the sword. When Magnus finds his old body, he searches the coffin for the sword but it is not there. While trying to leave, a shocked Annabeth walks in. She offers to take him to a safe place, but he declines. Annabeth gives Magnus her phone number and tells him to call her if he needs anything. Once outside, Hearth is assaulted and points out his attacker, Sam. While following Sam, they end up by the river. Sam is after the sword to prove her innocence. The four go to an underground sewer, where Blitz pulls a severed head out of his bag and throws it into the water. It rehydrates and is revealed to be the god Mimir. Mimir explains Magnus has a destiny and figured he could be used for the good of the worlds. Mimir tells them that Fenris Island is only accessible on the first full moon of the year. Mimir disappears after they are finished talking.<br><br>When they get to the dock they find the frost giant Harald who denies his boat to Hearth and Blitz, but lets Sam and Magnus take it. The two groups agree to meet at the library later. When they go to the bait storage shed they pick out a giant bull head and drag it on to the boat before the set out to sea. While at sea he asks Sam what Big Boy meant when he called Amir her 'intended', after she told him a little about her life. When they cross into Jotunheim they throw the bull head into the sea and wait. When they get a massive bite Sam helps him reel it in and stops Harald from cutting the line. When their catch breaches the surface, Sam introduced Magnus to her big brother. Harald pleads with them to cut the line and release the world serpent. Eventually the sea goddess Ran comes to the surface to demand they stop, as she can not scavenge on the ocean floor. They say they will let Jormungand go, but only if she barters with them. She agrees and they cut the line. When Magnus asks her for the Sword of Summer, she says she will give it to them in exchange for Magnus' soul. Magnus then threatens to summon the sword which will tear her net and release her treasures. The duo leave for the Library.<br><br>When Magnus reaches the public library he turns the sword into a white runestone pendant with a black Fehu on it. Big Boy then appears and asks for the apple, then morphs into a Jotun and reveals his name to be Utgard-Loki. Blitz tells Magnus they will go to his home world in the morning by climbing Yggdrasil. The three meet up with Sam at the public gardens by duck statues. Blitz explains that this is the easiest place to get to the world tree, but tells Magnus he must do it. As he goes to the next duckling Gunilla is across the river with two other Valkyries and his hall mates. Sam, Blitz and Hearth stall while Magnus finds the right one. On the fourth duck Magnus uses his sword and opens a rift. The four land on the world tree and follow the sword to their destination. Ratatosk the squirrel appears and attempts to attack them. Sam and Hearth hide under her hijab, while Magnus and Blitz go into a vanishing knothole.<br><br>The two end up wandering across the field, Folkvanger, where they are greeted by fallen warriors. Blitz leads him to an upside down ship where they meet the goddess Freya, who reveals herself as Blitz's mother. Freya tells them to go to Nidavellir to get her a new pair of earrings and that there is a dwarf who could make them a new rope to bind the beast if Gleipnir breaks, which is very likely. She tells them that they have until January 22 to find Fenris Wolf's island. The two go to Nidavellir and head to Nabbi's tavern where Blitz tells the bartender they want to contact Junior. Junior challenges him to a 'traditional' crafting contest with the usual rules. Junior leaves and Hearth and Sam come to tavern where explain what happened.<br><br>Magnus, Hearth, and Blitz show up at the contest. After making three items, the contest is declared over and the judges decide the winner. He sees Sam and wants to scold her for being late, but does not when he sees that she has a black eye and swollen lip. He asks her what happened and she says it was nothing too serious. Blitz wins and requests Junior give them the earrings and rope they asked him for, and tell them where Fenris Wolf's island is. Junior says that Thor might know where the island is. Junior sees Sam and calls her out as a shapeshifter and claims she cheated; he orders the four to be killed before they run for it. While running, Blitz is taken in a golden net to his mother. Magnus readies his sword, which talks, startling everyone. The sword fights the dwarves on its own. They meet up with Hearth who takes them to a river leading out of Nidavellir. When the dwarf mob approaches Magnus turns the sword, Jack, back into a pendant and collapses. Sam and Hearth support him when they jump into the river.<br><br>Magnus dreams he is on Naglfar with Loki. The trickster tries to convince Magnus to give up his search for the wolf's island, and states that he convinced his daughter, Hel, to take Magnus in to her domain.<br><br>As Loki said, Magnus wakes up to a goat giving him mouth to mouth. He finds and heals Sam and Hearth, The goat introduces himself as Tanngnjóstr, but says to call him Otis. He says his master is Thor and he was separated from him. Magnus summons Jack to track the god. While Otis takes them to Thor, Sam tells Magnus about Hearthstone's past. Otis then tells them they were unconscious for about a day, much to their shock. Then they meet up with Tanngrisnr, who goes by Marvin, and tells them that Thor is drowning due to a giantess and that if the trio fail to save Thor he will kill them. After Magnus saves Thor using Jack, Thor offers him and his friends to stay for dinner.<br><br>Over dinner Thor explains that his hammer Mjolnir has gone missing, and asks Magnus to check to see if giant Geirrod has it. Blitzen rejoins the group. While going to the giant's home, Hearthstone summons one of Sleipnir's sons, Stanley, to help them pass a cliff. When at the house, they see a caged swan that Sam recognized as Gunilla. The squad try to negotiate with Geirrod's children for Gunilla and for Thor's weapon. After failing to reach an agreement, Magnus uses Jack to kill the giants, while Blitz and Hearth rescue Gunilla and aid Magnus out of the room. They meet Geirrod in the hall where they ask him for Thor's weapon and says he will only give it to them if they survive a game. While the game is going on, Thor comes in and takes the weapon and "sends them where they need to go".<br><br>When Magnus lands on Bunker Hill, he is greeted by Hel. She offers Magnus a chance to come with her to Helheim to be with his mother, if he agrees to abandon his quest. He says that is not what his mother would want and he says if he sees the goddess of death again, he will cut her in two. She then vanishes and he suddenly appears five stories above an asphalt roof and falls. The duo leave to find Blitzen and Hearthstone, who are at Long Wharf with rides to Lyngvi Island, where Fenris Wolf is.<br><br>Once on the island, they find the wolf. Magnus tries to restrain Jack, who is destined to cut the wolf's ropes. Fenris reveals he sent the wolves to kill Magnus's mother so that the hardships to come would make him strong enough to retrieve Jack. Soon after Gunilla arrives with two other Valkyries and his hall mates. Gunilla tries to get the squad arrested, but the hall mates turn against her. Surt and the fire giants arrive to claim the sword and kill everyone. After Magnus successfully uses Jack to retie the ropes, he runs in to battle and sees Surt kill Gunilla. Enraged, Magnus throws Jack who creates a rift in the worlds that sucks the fire Giants to Muspellheim. After defeating the enemies, they all get on a boat, where Magnus goes to aid Halfborn Gunderson, who is dying. Magnus uses the last of his strength to revive Halfborn and passes out. When Magnus wakes up he is greeted by his father, Frey, who he immediately hugs. Frey congratulates him for rejecting Hel's offer. Frey says that Magnus has accepted his fate and that the Sword of Summer is now his. Before Magnus leaves Frey gives him his mother's ashes and the flyer Annabeth gave him tells him to contact her. Magnus wakes up in the Hotel's lobby and is summoned to the feast hall.<br><br>When he and the others arrive at the feast hall he explains to the thanes about what he has done on the quest. When he finishes the thanes say that his actions were heroic but since he left with out permission he must be punished. X then speaks up and reveals himself to be Odin. Odin offers him a chance to either relocate to Folkvanger or return to the land of the living. The son of Frey says he is happy at Valhalla and wishes to remain there. Odin gives him and his friends full access to all of the nine worlds.<br><br>The next day he, Sam, Blitz and Hearth attend a funeral for the fallen Valkyries. He says he will visit them from time to time and goes to meet Annabeth. He and Annabeth scatter his mother's ashes on the Blue Hills. The two try to mend the bond between their two families and agree to tell each other about their lives.<br><br><h4>The Hammer of Thor</h4>
After not seeing Sam for six weeks, Magnus meets her for coffee at the Thinking Cup. She is about to tell him about an informant that will meet them until she is alerted that a hero is about to die and leaves. He grabs a table and is soon greeted by Otis. The goat tells him that they might know where Mjølnir is, namely in Provincetown, where it is being guarded by a Wight. Before Otis can say more he is hit with an ax and dies before he can be healed. The Son of Frey sees the assassin and goes after him.<br><br>During the chase the assassin warns Magnus not to go to Provincetown, then topples off the bridge and disappears. Magnus then returns to the café to find Sam, with a black eye, wondering why Otis is dead; he explains what happened. Sam then describes how her father Loki is making life difficult for her at home, that the giant have become more restless and are preparing to invade Midgard.<br><br>Sam then states that they will need Blitz and Hearth, who are hiding in one of Mimir's safe houses. Magnus then asks why he has not been told any of this and Sam responds by saying that he needed to spend his time training, because he will need all his skill in order to survive the mission. Before Sam leaves Magnus realizes that she got her black eye from the enherji she saved. She says it will be explained at dinner and that it came from her brother.<br><br>Magnus then walks back to one of Valhalla's Midgard entrances and gives espresso beans to the homeless on the way. He then enters the hotel to see Helgi, the hotel receptionist, dressed in taters. According to Hunding, the newcomer did that to him. Helgi is in a bad mood because of it and tells Hunding to floss the dragon's teeth. Before he leaves Magnus gives him an espresso bean from the Thinking Cup.<br><br>He arrives to floor nineteen to have a cheetah run over his foot. Following behind it are his hallmates, who seem to be chasing it. According to T.J it is their new hallmate, who had shapeshifted into a cheetah. Apparently it moved into X's old room and completely destroyed it. When the group shows Magnus the room he is surprised to find that it has a design similar to his. The room is filled with pottery with the symbol of Loki covering all of them. Before they can answer Magnus's questions about the room's appearance, the lunch horn rings and they say they will tell him at the table, but Magnus tells them that he has something to check first.<br><br>He then goes to his room and summons Jack for some advice. As Jack answers his questions, T.J arrives in the room to remind Magnus that it is time for the battles to begin. As they arrive for the battle they find Mallory Keen and Halfborn arguing. As they calm down, a raven flies by and drops a sack in front of Magnus. Inside is a weasel, which transforms into a young teenager as T.J is planning on eating it. The teen's appearance seems familiar to Magnus. The new Einherji introduces themself as Alex Fierro, who is at that moment a girl. This news shocks the group as they believed that she was male that morning and that her appearance didn't seem like a male or female. Magnus stares at her when she reveals this information, as to him she definitely looked like a male a minute ago but now definitely looks like a female.<br><br>During the battle, Magnus gets a vision and pain sent to him by Loki through his uncle. Loki tells him to come to a wedding in five days if he wants the hammer; the god of evil then sets Magnus to self-destruct before Alex decapitates him. He then dreams that his severed head is with Hearth and Blitz, who are asked by Mimir to protect someone. After that he sees two giants talking about a wedding and Thor's Hammer. He then wakes up in his room, much later then usual, and is summoned to the feast hall by ravens. At dinner he tells his hallmates about his dream and Halfborn teases him for staring at Alex. After dinner he talks with Sam about her upcoming wedding and they agree to go to Provincetown to get the hammer.<br><br>The next morning he meets Sam after breakfast and they head to Provincetown where they meet Blitz and Hearth. They tell Magnus that they were hiding in one of Mimir's safe houses; after learning that Blitz might die on the mission he becomes worried but is reassured by the dwarf. They find the wight's tomb and fall in to it. After Hearth breaks his ankle in a fall Magnus heals the elf. They find an iron coffin and he asks Jack if he senses the Hammer. After they open the coffin the corpse of a king opens his eyes. The Corpse introduces himself as Gellir, Prince of the Danes. He thanks them for freeing him and orders his body guards to kill them. After they take care of old business, the zombies advance on Magnus and his friends. They fight the draugrs and win, and when they realize this was a trap, Loki and Randolph appear. Magnus is shocked to learn that his uncle and Loki are working with each other. He is shocked and enraged when Loki puts Sam in a coma. He learns from Loki that the Chases are descendants of Norse kings, and that only the men of his family can wield Snoknung.<br><br>He also learns that Loki can send pain to him through Randolph. As Loki orders Randolph to attack, he leaps in thinking Sam is the target, realizing at the last that moment that Blitzen was the target. In a fit of rage, Magnus attacks his uncle, disarming him of the sword and his pinky and index fingers. He tries to heal Blitz but is unable to. He takes Skofnung and keeps it for himself, and Loki tells them to find the Skofnung stone in Alfheim. After Loki leaves he opens up the cavern, petrifying Blitz to give him more time.<br><br>At the Provincetown Airport, he watches over Sam while she prays. Moments later Sam's flying instructor, Barry Al-Jabbar, along with Amir comes in to meet with them. After they load Blitz on the plane, they take off to Alfheim. As they are about to take off, Barry is possessed by the goat assassin. He tells them to go to Jotunheim after they are done in Alfeim. When they reach cruising altitude he reassures Amir that Sam is the Sam she's always been. He, Hearth and a petrified Blitz jump out of the plane and head to the world of elves.<br><br>They land in the yard of the Makepiece family. Hearth gives him sunglasses to block out most of the sunlight. On the way to Hearth's house they are stopped by two police officers. They ask them if they trespassed on the Makepiece property. Once Magnus tells them Hearthstone is deaf, they realize who he is and take them to Hearth's father, Alderman. When they arrive at Hearth's family home, he is surprised by the size and appearance of the property. They are greeted by Inge, one of the house's staff. When Alderman arrive he lets the police know that Magnus is a son of Frey, the officers apologize and leave skidishly. He invites Magnus and his son in. As they sit and talk in the living room. He requests that they borrow the Snoknung stone, which Alderman does not allow. But he is willing to let them have it if Magnus stays with them for a few days, attends some parties, and takes pictures with Alderman. He reassures Hearthstone that he supports him. Alderman then calls Inge to show them to Hearth's old room. Magnus is shocked by Hearthstone's living conditions. He learns why his friend must pay his wergild, as he and Hearth wonder what to do. Inge suggest they rob the Careful One, a dwarf living in Alfheim with enough gold to cover the hide. Magnus and Hearth reluctantly agree. That night, Magnus dreams of Randolph, his family, Sam and Amir on Randolph's yacht. Then it shifts to Alex Fierro yelling at Loki; after that the trickster god tells Magnus to come to the wedding. Then he sees Thor destroying a mountain and tells Magnus to get his hammer back. In the Morning Inge tells them where to find Andvari. Before they leave he teases Hearthstone about her liking him.<br><br>They search the forest until they come across the well where Adiron died, then move on. They eventually find a promising waterfall and Hearth summons a rune that causes the river to explode. Magnus summons Jack who explains that as a side effect of the rune, the wielder becomes aggressive for a short time. Magnus becomes worried about the fish and reads their minds to find the dwarf. He succeeds and brings him to the surface. Andvari changes into his true form and threatens to kill them. After a brief struggle, Andvari gives them his gold and the ring. He warns them that the ring is cursed and to be careful. Magnus and Hearth take the gold to Alderman. They arrive back to Alderman's house and dump the gold on the rug. He finds one hair showing and threatens to take half the treasure if they do not finish it now. Magnus shows him the ring and warns him about the curse to no avail. Alderman tells them to stay for a party he is throwing in Magnus' honor. He gives them the Skofnung stone and they unpetrify Blitz and use the stone to heal his wound. They fill him in and are glad he is fine. Inge then comes in and tells them the Party has began. They see Alderman talking and tossing bits of the treasure at his uneasy looking guests. Magnus is shocked when he tells him that the son of Frey is his permanent guest. After he declines he orders the Nøkks, water spirits, to kill all the guests. They play violins to make everyone die of heartbreak. He commands Jack to attack them. After Hearth breaks the windows, Magnus yells at the guests to flee. When the police that took them to Alderman start to fire at them he has Jack distract them. When they reach the well, they cut open a rift to another world.<br><br>The three of them land in a stairwell. He notices Hearthstone is injured and heals him. He gives the Skofnung Stone to Blitzen and he and Hearth head to his place for the night. He heads to the roof to find Sam, Amir, Halfborn, and Alex. He learns that Sam has been trying to get Amir to see the Bifrost bridge. He gives Amir a pep talk about seeing the rainbow bridge until they see it. They are called up it by Heimdall. He helps Amir onto the bifrost after Sam and Alex, and is told by Halfborn to be ready for them when he meets Heimdall. The four of them soon encounter Heimdall and explain their quest to him. He agrees to help them. Magnus and his companions learn that giants are planning to invade Midgard after Thrym's wedding and they are not allowing any aesir or vanir, so that none of the gods can take the hammer back. Heimdall also informs him that Randolph is going to attend. The guardian of the bifrost also shows them a message from Utgard-Loki telling them to come to him if they want to succeed. Heimdall dissolves the bifrost from below their feet and lets them fall to Midgard close to the transportation center, where Amir offers to cook them a late meal. He, Sam, and Alex discuss what to do about Utgard-Loki. When Amir comes out they eat and continue to form a strategy. When they finish they call it a night.<br><br>After retrieving the Skofnung Sword from T.J., he and Alex head to Randolph's mansion. When they arrive they search it for clues about where the wedding might be. While they are looking, Alex tells him why she/he changes her gender and what Loki did with her family. They find a picture of Bridal Veil Falls in New Hampshire with a wedding invitation to it. They conclude that this is the entrance to Thrym's lair for the wedding and leave to tell the others.<br><br>The two of them meet up with Sam, Blitz, Hearth, and Stanley at the park. Magnus gives the sword and stone to Sam for safe keeping. He, Alex, and Blitz ride Stanley to Jotunnheim while Sam flies Hearth. They make their way to the world of giants were they hit a tree. Moments later they discover the tree is a shoelace for a giant named Tiny. Tiny points them in the direction of Utgard-Loki's bowling ally and tells them to bring his bowling bag with them to show that they are friendly. He leaves them at that before they see the massive bowling bag. At this point Magnus considers giving up until Blitz says he can use magic to shrink the bag. He says he needs to borrow Jack and Magnus' hair, much to his shock. Alex starts to tease him about it until Blitz says he needs the blood of a shapeshifter, much to Alex's shock. The Son of Frey reluctantly agrees. While Blitzen and Jack are working, he and Alex stand watch. He heals Alex's infected wound and learns a little about her. After Blitzen finishes and demonstrates the bag, Magnus grabs a hold of Jack and passes out. The next morning the three set out for Utgard Lanes. When they arrive he spots and calls out to Utgard-Loki, and the sorcerer shows them that he has Sam and Hearth. After that they claim guest rights and return Tiny's bag. The king of Jotunheim returns their friends to them. He explains that in order to get the information they need, they must compete in tasks to prove their worth or die trying. Magnus and his friends talk about what to do when Utgard-Loki appears before them. He tells them that he does not want Thrym to marry Sam because with the support of Loki he can become king of Jotunheim and invade Midgard. The group lets Sam compete in an ax throwing competition with a child giant, and she deduces that the child is fear itself and the next competition is held. After Hearth beats a giant at pinball and Blitz improves a giant's appearance, he and Alex are teamed up in a bowling match against two giants, they start and their balls stop short of the pins while the other team bowls with ease. Alex finds out that their line is rigged and leads to the white mountains in Midgard. At this Magnus bowls in their opponent's line and dents it. They look concerned until Tiny says their lane is unbeatable. Magnus has an idea that, with Alex's help, the two can dispel the portal and tie the game. They try and succeed with Magnus looking into Alex's memories. He and Alex both bowl a strike and tie the game. Their friends congratulate them and they request five minutes with Utgard-Loki to tell them what they want. The giant king tells them of Loki's true plan, to use Thrym's wedding to Sam as a way to get the Skofnung Sword and Stone to free himself. He gives them two options, die at this moment or find the hammer themselves. Soon after that the giants give chase.<br><br>Before they can be killed by the giants, they are saved by the goddess Sif and taken to her home. She promises them a trophy that can give them a free meal at any Asgard restaurant. She tells them to tell Thor about the information they learned about his missing hammer. They meet with the thunder god and tell him what they know. Thor is thinking of way to get his hammer back until Alex volunteers to be the bride. Everyone is in shock but they agree to it as it is the best option on a tight schedule. Thor offers to shelter him, Sam, and Alex. While Hearth and Blitz head to Valhalla to recruit einherjar for the assault. The next morning he heads to breakfast where Sam and Alex are waiting. As Alex is lead away to get ready by Sif, he and Sam have a conversation and he tells her she is the bravest person he knows, she in turn invites him to her real wedding. He is amazed at how Alex looks and is teased by the child of Loki. As Sam is getting dressed, Sif dresses him in an old fashioned white and gold tuxedo, much to the amusement of Sam and Alex. Sif then sends them on their way to meet up with the rest of the group.<br><br>Once they regroup, Magnus helps Sam and Alex onto the chariot and they set off for Bridal Veil falls. Their they meet Thrynga. She leads them down a long passage into a barroom. Once they arrive Thrynga orders the bar to be cleaned up, during this time Magnus, Sam, and Alex see if they can find the hammer before the wedding. He and Sam keep food from hitting Alex during the feast. During this time he notices that Thrynga has a plain of her own. After that Thrym opens a passage to Loki's prison so that he can be a part of the wedding. On the way to Loki's prison, he asks Thrym if he fully trusts Loki. Thrym tells him that he does, but only to get revenge on the Aesir for slaughtering his family. When they reach the chamber of Loki, the bound god asks for the sword and stone. After he sees that all are who they should be, he tells Thrynga to release their special guest, Randolph. As his uncle requests the sword and stone, Magnus seems hesitant until he has no other choice but to do so, however he tells Randolph that he still has living family. Soon Alex reveals that she is not Sam and starts to kill Thrym, he summons Jack and Thrynga starts to attack Magnus. They both land in a pool of discarded venom and the giantess grabs him by the neck. Before he can dissolve or suffocate, he grabs Sam's ax that is embedded in the giantess's side and hits her in the head with it. Soon Blitz, Hearth and his hall mates arrive and attack the giants, however Randolph frees Loki during the fight. He watches as Loki kills the snake that has tortured him for the last millennium. As the trickster urges them forward, the son of Frey knows that he and his friends cannot defeat him. As the gods arrive Loki flees. He tries to save Randolph, but he falls into a cavern leading to Helheim. He is treated by Vidar for his ribs and he asks Heimdall about his uncle, he responds that it is better he not know his uncle's fate. He checks in with Sam and Alex, who are angered by the outcome of the battle and shaken up respectively. Thor invites them to Valhalla for a feast.<br><br>Back in Valhalla, he and his friends are too distracted by Loki's escape to enjoy the party. As they are about to head back to their rooms, Helgi asks them to come to his office. He tells them that despite Loki escaping, Ragnarok can be delayed if he is captured and bound again. Magnus and his friends are tasked with this quest. After meeting with Helgi, he invites Hearth and Blitz to spend the night with him. Blitz reassures him that Loki escaping was not his fault. In the morning Sam slips Magnus a note inviting him for coffee. Before he goes he meets with Alex to ask how Loki's commands have no effect on her. Alex states that she makes the power her own. He meets Sam and she tells him what the ravens have told her: that they must head for Scandinavia by sea in the middle of summer. She also tells him that after Loki is recaptured, she well retire as a Valkyrie and lead a normal life. She apologizes for taking him to Valhalla, and he says that it is the best thing to ever happen to him. When he is done he goes to meet his cousin.<br><br>Magnus and Annabeth meet up in New London. She tells him about a fallen god and Roman emperors trying to destroy the world. He tells her that they need to get to Scandinavia in midsummer. Annabeth tells him it is time he met her boyfriend, Percy Jackson.<br><br><h4>The Ship of the Dead</h4>
Magnus is training with Percy on the USS Constitution by jumping off of the stern into water while Annabeth and Alex watch. After he lands in the water and heals himself, Jack shows up and pulls him to shore. The four demigods them have lunch. During lunch they discuss plans for their quest and he is concerned about what is at stake if he and his team fails. Annabeth and Percy head back to New York City and he and Alex head to the Chase Mansion.<br><br>As they arrive at the house, the two find the front doors broken off and a dead wolf in the foyer. They explore the house for clues, Randolph stated in his will that he wanted Magnus to pay close attention to his papers. When they reach the library on the top floor he finds family pictures of him, his mother, his uncles and his grandparents. Alex calls him over when he finds a wolf on the roof. They decide to let the wolf in and he summons Jack for help. He lets the wolf in and it takes a drinking horn but is decapitated before it can leave. They look over a book that was in the horn on the roof and find that Randolph has made a plan to stop Loki, using three objects. A raven comes to them with a message from T.J., telling them they are setting sail immediately and to come back.<br><br>Back in Valhalla he quickly grabs his gear and heads to the docks is hall mates are at. He arrives to see Helgi and Hunding coming to sign them out and wishes them luck. He sets up his boat just as high tide is coming. His friends are momentarily puzzled by the ship's neon yellow color and quickly pack their things and set sail. Just as they set out Magnus has a vision of Loki telling him Naglfar should set sail by the end of the week. Out of his trance and tells to to grab an oar or they'll go of a waterfall into the void. The four manage to avoid the waterfall and make it to Boston Hardor. They meet up with Sam, Alex and Amir. They pick up the children of Loki and head out to get Hearthstone and Blitzen. He talks with Sam about her father's conversation with him. Just as they are however, nine women come out of the water and pull them in. The group surfaces in a pot and are pulled out by Aegir. He greets them warmly and invites them for a meal. He says that is any of them is named 'Magnus Chase' then he would have to kill them. He is shocked to see Hearthstone and Blitzen in cages about to be cooked. He manages to persuad Aegir to spare his captive friends and they sit down for dinner and says his name is 'Jimmy'. Just as they are about to eat one of Aegir's daughters says she knows him and calls him by his name. As the sea god is about to kill them Magnus stalls and reminds them of guest rights. Aegir agrees and talks a about mead until Magnus devises a plan. He tells Aegir that he will flyt Loki and get him the mead of Kvasir. Aegir is reluctant as he promoted his wife that he would kill him if he ever saw him. Their host agrees that if they were to escape while he was not looking he would keep it a secret. Aegir leaves and his daughters attack. Magnus and his friends put up a fight but they are out numbered. He summons Jack to help before praying to his father for help. Njord, his grandfather, arrives and distracts them just long enough for Hearth to take out a wall so they could escape.<br><br>They surface and Njord assures them that they are safe in his company. Magnus notices that Alex has switched gender. He, Blitz and Hearth stay above deck to speak with Njord. He tells them the best way to get to Naglfar is through Skahdi's harbor, and that he would need Kvasir's Mead to defeat Loki in a flyting. He tells them that Hearth and Blitz must go and find the Whetstone while Magnus and the crew should sail to Jorvik and find and defeat Hrungnir to get the location of Kvasir's mead. Magnus reluctantly agrees under the condition that he joins his friends when they are ready. Njord sends his friends away before wishing Magnus luck and leaving himself.<br><br>As the Big Banana heads towards Jorvik he speaks with Mallory, who is wondering why Njord could not just sent them to where they needed to go, Halfborn, who tells him that it is hard for those who have been in Valhalla for years to adjust to their modern day homes, and T.J., who tells him to be careful during his flyting with Loki. The next morning he is shaken awake by Alex and told to help with Sam's training. He watches as the children of Loki practice their shape shifting until Alex calls him over and has him and Jack go two-on-one against Sam. After they practice the three rest and he asks how Sam can do their quest during Ramadan. The three talk for a while longer. Around mid afternoon he talk hold of Jack and passes out. He dreams of his father, Odin, Heimdall, and Kvasir searching for Loki. His dream then shifts to Kvasir being lured into a cave by the dwarves Fjalar and Gjalar and hears the god's cries of pain as he is killed. His dream then shifts again to the day Alex's father kicked her out. Alex then shakes him awake when they reach Jorvik.<br><br>As Magnus, T.J. and Alex scout out the town, Mallory, Halfborn and Sam watch over the Big Banana. They find the Viking tourist center and find Hrungir. He offers to kill them until he challenges them to a contest to the death. He tells them to meat him at dawn and they leave to find a pottery studio. They find one and Alex rents it out for the day and the three prepare a ceramic warrior. He makes coils and talks with Alex about her family. He also contacts Sam to inform her of their current events. The three have dinner at a fish and chips restaurant and head back to the pottery studio. Alex takes a chair while he and T.J. make makeshift beds in the back. He dreams of hoards of draugars preparing Naglfar and listening to Hrym, the captain of the ship. His dream then shifts to Odin presenting the whetstone to a massive giant. He wakes up screaming and is handed a garlic bagel for breakfast. Alex then brings their clay warrior to life and they head out to face Hrungnir. They meet the jotnar at King's Square and the fight begins. Moments into the fight Alex is trapped under Hrungnir's clay warrior after pulling hers free of it, he goes to help her when T.J. is about to be crushed by Hrungnir. After the giant releases the son of Tyr, Magnus summons Jack to guard Alex and he heals T.J. and sees his memories of his childhood and early days as a soldier for the Union. When he heals Alex he sees himself, puzzling him. As soon as T.J. defeats Hrungnir. He defeated giant tells them to go to Flåm in Norway to find the mead, but it will be heavily guarded. After T.J. blows up Hrungnir and gets shrapnel stuck in his head Magnus is unable to heal him. The three make their way back to the big banana.<br><br>They crew make their way up the River Oure and speculate that it would take a while to get from England to Norway. He speaks with Mallory about how she died and soon after Hearth and Blitz arrive and tell Magnus they need his help in Alfheim with Alderman.<br><br>The three head to Alderman's mansion, now in ruins, and head deeper into the property. They eventually come to a cave where they think Alderman is hiding. After sundown, Alderman, in the form of a dragon, emerges from the cave momentairily before going back inside. The trio is shocked by this revelation. He tries to consult Hearth, who says he best thing to do for Alderman is to kill him. He decides to kill Alderman, as it he deed would taint Hearth. He plans to go up to Alderman via underground tunnels and have Jack kill him by going in his belly and fleeing before the dragon's acidic blood can reach him. They practice their plan until nightfall. He has a dream of Loki taunting him for their plan to stop him before waking up. Alderman emerges from his cave when he hears the voice of his dead son. Magnus just misses his target when Hearth showed up but the dragon backed up when Blitz came to defend Hearth. With his target in sight Magnus strikes. He escapes the tunnel safe and emerges to see Alderman die and Hearth's brother leave. He and Blitz take the whetstone and Andarvi's treasure. They go to return it and he is shocked that Hearth had to eat his father's heart. He and Blitz bring the treasure back to the river and when they get back they see Hearth roasting the heart. Hearth asks him to take over and, getting lost in the conversation, he drops the heart. Magnus grabs it before it slips into the fire and he licks his fingers. Everyone is shocked and he hears what birds are saying about him. They head back to the Big Banana.<br><br>They return to the Big Banana and tell the group what happened. Everyone is concerned about what would happen to Magnus, but Mallory brushes it as a boost in his powers. The next day they arrive at Flåm. They dock the ship and split into two teams to find a train station. He goes with Sam and Mallory while Halfborn, Alex and T.J. head in a separate direction. Within a few minutes Mallory stops the group and chases after the old woman she saw before she died. They chase her to a train station and board the train. After two cars they catch up with her and they talk. The woman reveals herself to be Frigg, Mallory's mother. She tells them that Loki will set sail in a day or two and shows them where to find the mead. The goddess leaves and the train starts to move. They jump out the window of the moving train and land at the bottom of the revine. He heals Mallory's broken arm and, after a pep talk from Sam, move. They make their way to the waterfall where the mead is and devise a plan. They walk up to the slaves guarding the fields leading to the mead. They say that they will help them and Mallory offers to use the whetstone to sharpen their scythes so they can work fast. They do this and they finish the field. Mallory says she will give the whetstone to who ever catches it. The the giants accidentally impale themselves on their synthesis and they continue. They try to open the door to get to the mead but it is locked. Suddenly they hear the voice of Gunlod, a prisoner and daughter of the mead's keeper. She gives them the mead after they pry open the door and she tells them her father and uncle will be their soon enough. Magnus talks to some near by crowd who say they will help him, he sends Sam and Mallory back to the big banana with the mead while he takes care of Suttung. The giant tells him that Naglfar is close to launching and that they can get to Nilfheim by sailing across the coast of Jotunheim. He swings at Magnus with his ax and they block it. Magnus calls to the crows and, with a delayed response, they attack. He stabs the giant's foot with Jack and the giant accidentally hits himself in the head with his ax blade. He heads back to the ship after giving the crows the thrall's scythes as payment.<br><br>When he gets back to the big banana he sees that his friends have taken care of Baugi. They tell him of how Halfborn took on the giant single handily after he insulted Flåm. They set sail. He speaks with Halfborn about his feelings of returning to his hometown. After the Berserker leaves he talks with Sam about his worries of losing the flyt to Loki. She assures him that he can do it and heads bellow deck. He falls asleep and is woken up by Blitz when they reach Jotunheim.<br><br>The big banana gets stuck in the ice and they try to move it with minimal luck. They decide to walk to shore and huddle up in teams to keep warm. He and Alex huddle to get her and they eventually get to shore. Just be for they reach it Alex starts to talk to Magnus and she kisses him, leaving him shocked. Skadi arrives and invites them in to explain themselves. They bath, change clothes and have a hot meal while they explain their quest to Skadi. She tells them Loki is with in a ski ride way from them. She gives them permission to spend the night with her and tell Magnus to drink the mead before he leaves. He has a restless night thinking about the flyting and Alex. He goes into a great hall and sees Sam doing her morning prayers. They talk about the flyting and she gives him some hope before going on to talk about Alex. Skadi arrives and tells them to wake the others. As they prepare to leave he drinks the mead and the head out.<br><br>They reach the ship and Magnus learns of the plan his friends have formed behind his back. T.J., Blitz, Hearth, Halfborn and Mallory will lead a distraction to allow him, Sam and Alex to sneak on board and flyt Loki. Hearth gives him the Othala rune and they leave. Magnus activates the rune and the three turn invisible. They head towards the ship and Magnus hears the voices of his dead relatives, telling him to come to them, but he is snapped out of it by Alex and the group makes their way on board. After their friends make a distraction, he and the children of Loki set out to find their father. The rune wears off and they are attacked. Magnus summons a Jack to keep him safe and unleashes the peace of Frey to disarm everyone on Naglfar. Loki arrives and Magnus challenges him to a flyting. The trickster declines and moves in to kill them. Hrym intervenes and tells Loki he is honor bound to accept. The tricker grudgingly accepts and the flyting begins. Magnus does poorly and starts to shrink. He realizes that he can not win playing by Loki's rules, so he plays by his. He starts to complement each of his friends one by one and tells Loki he is alone. After Mallory imprisons loki the the walnut Hrym declares Magnus the winner and apologizes in advance for having to kill him. The group makes a break for it and Jack points out that he left him out of his speech. Magnus promises to have Braugi write him an epic. They reach the end of Naglfar and jump on Sam's orders. They land on the backs of water horses and they swim away just as the harbor freezes over again.<br><br>They spend three days at sea with very minimal communication. After a brief conversation, Sam tells him to talk with Alex. He speaks with the child of Loki and she tells him she needs her space for the moment. They arrive at Vigridr, the battle field where the einharjar will one day die during Ragnorok, and are greeted by the gods. The gods congratulate them and take them to a tent for a feast. They hand over Loki to the Aesir and they are all given an autographed copy of Odin's newest autobiography, a feast in their honor, and Turkish bathrobes for the einharjar. The all-father offers Magnus a personal reward for defeating Loki. They return to the hotel and celebrate their victory. They have a tug-o-war over a vad of chocolate syrup and his team losses, mainly because of Hunding. He goes back to his room to shower when Alex, now male, shows up. He tells Magnus about his confession towards him again and kisses him. Magnus is both startled and happy. Alex also agrees with his idea from the gods.<br><br>He talks with Annabeth on the phone and she tells him something happened in California. Within a month of their quest, Magnus had turned the Chase mansion into the Chase Space, a shelter for homeless youths. He and Alex work with the kids while Blitz and Hearth work as cooks. On the Fourth of July everyone gathers onto the roof and watches the fireworks. He and Alex, now female, hold hands while they cherish the present. </div>

<p>
The Superhero Database Classification number, or SHDB Class, is a number that represents the overall 'power' of a character. All traits of a character are used for calculating the Classification.
</p>
<h5>What it DOESN'T mean</h5>
<p>
This doesn't mean that a higher class would always beat a lower class character. But the bigger the difference in Class is, the more obvious it is who'll win in a fight.
</p>
<h5>How is this calculated</h5>
<pre class="footnote">( INT^1.3 + (STR*0.5 )^2 + (SPE*0.5)^2 + DUR^1.6 + (POW + (SPS*SPL))^2 + COM^1.8 ) ^ TIER</pre>
<h6>Super Power Score and Level</h6>
<p>Every Super Power has a score (SPS) that is used to calculate the Class. Each Super Power also has 3 levels (SPL). The level is set when connecting that Super Power to a character. The level determines the final score, of the Super Power, being used in the calculation.
