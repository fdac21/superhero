<h3>Sonic The Hedgehog's History</h3>
<i><h4>Past</h4></i>
Not much is known about Sonic's early life. He was born on Christmas Island with his abnormal ability to run at super-speed, but his love for adventure eventually called him away from his home. Since then, he has spent his life traveling the globe, driven by his restless spirit, in search of adventures to satisfy his thirst for thrills.<br><br>At some point, Sonic met Dr. Ivo Robotnik and they became enemies. Sonic would subsequently fight Robotnik in an untold number of confrontations as the scientist attempted time and again to conquer the world, with Sonic foiling the doctor's plans each time. Despite their many battles, Sonic did not really account for his adversary.<br><br><i><h4>Sonic the Hedgehog (1991)</h4></i>
In Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic heard the news about Dr. Robotnik invading South Island after the doctor had discovered some powerful relics, called the "Chaos Emeralds", which were hidden on the island and which he now sought to produce weapons of mass destruction. Annoyed by Robotnik's perseverance, Sonic hurried to South Island to stop him. Once Sonic arrived, he was met by Robotnik, who revealed his new method to enslave the animal residents: trapping them inside robot shells. With this method, he could turn them into robotic servants called Badniks, a method that left Sonic greatly shocked.<br><br>Despite having the whole island as his enemy, Sonic resolved to save the animals and get the Chaos Emeralds before Dr. Robotnik could get his hands on them. After traveling across the island while freeing the animal residents and securing the Chaos Emeralds, Sonic entered the doctor's local stronghold, where he defeated the mad scientist and drove him off the island. With Robotnik defeated, Sonic reunited with his friends to Green Hill Zone, where he released the Chaos Emeralds, with their power ensured the island's prosperity.<br><br><i><h4>Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (16-bit)</h4></i>
In Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic was traveling the world in the Tornado in search of adventure, when he discovered West Side Island. Deciding to land there, Sonic began exploring this new region. After a few days, Sonic noticed that someone was following him and saw it was a two-tailed fox cub named Miles "Tails" Prower, who had come to idolize him. As Tails hid upon being discovered, Sonic chose to ignore him and tried running away, but Tails continued to follow him and even kept up with his speed. Impressed by the fox's tenacity and ability to keep up, Sonic decided to let him tag along despite his disinterest in him. Later, during an early afternoon, Sonic was napping under the Tornado when he was awoken by explosions and saw Badniks attacking West Side Island. Standing beside Tails, who was watching him, during the initial attack, Sonic knew that Dr. Robotnik was behind this and ran into the center of the attack to find the mad doctor.<br><br>It turned out that it was indeed Robotnik who was at his old schemes again. This time, he was turning the island residents into Badniks to find the Chaos Emeralds, which were located on the island, to create the Death Egg for conquering the world. Sonic thus set out to stop Robotnik, retrieve the Chaos Emeralds, and save the island, with Tails following him all the way. When Sonic obtained all seven of the Chaos Emeralds, he discovered that their powers could turn him into Super Sonic. All the while, Tails proved to be a great assistance to Sonic with his unique skills, and the two began forming a strong bond.<br><br>After freeing West Side Island, Sonic and Tails followed Robotnik to the Wing Fortress Zone on board the Tornado,[11] where Tails and the Tornado were shot down, forcing Sonic to go on alone. When Dr. Robotnik escaped in his rocket ship, Sonic found Tails coming to his aid in a rocket-enhanced Tornado. Catching up to the doctor's rocket in the Tornado, Sonic rode the ship to the Death Egg where Sonic fought Robotnik's Mecha Sonic, followed by Robotnik in the Death Egg Robot. After a heated battle, Robotnik was defeated once again, which triggered a chain reaction that made the Death Egg crash, but Sonic escaped by jumping off into space.<br><br>Falling through the atmosphere, Sonic was saved by Tails who had flown into the sky to look for Sonic, and together the two of them flew through the sky. With their adventure at an end, Tails had become Sonic's best friend. Sonic, in turn, took the fox under his wing as his sidekick, setting the course for their future.<br><br><i><h4>Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (8-bit)</h4></i>
In Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic, after having saved South Island, had just returned to the island from a casual adventure when he found a note from Tails. In the note, Tails said that he and the Animals of the island had been kidnapped by Dr. Robotnik and were now being held captive in the Crystal Egg. To reach Tails, Sonic had to collect the Chaos Emeralds. The note also warned Sonic of Robotnik's six Master Robots, who were waiting for him. With no time to waste, Sonic set off to save Tails.<br><br>Along his adventure, Sonic got the Chaos Emeralds as instructed and took out the Robot Masters, before facing Robotnik in the Crystal Egg Zone. However, the doctor escaped through a teleporter upon his defeat. With Tails still missing, Sonic almost despaired, but then Tails appeared from the teleporter, unharmed. Though confused at this turn of events, Sonic was happily reunited with Tails and the duo departed for new adventures together.<br><br><i><h4>SegaSonic the Hedgehog</h4></i>
In SegaSonic the Hedgehog, Sonic was captured by Dr. Robotnik and imprisoned on Eggman Island where he was to be executed along with Mighty the Armadillo and Ray the Flying Squirrel. Teaming up with Mighty and Ray, Sonic escaped his cell, only to be blown to the other side of the island with Mighty and Ray by a geyser triggered by Robotnik. Working together to escape the island, the trio got to Eggman's Tower where they confronted Robotnik. Robotnik, however, triggered the self-destruction of the tower, with Sonic, Ray and Mighty managing to escape just in time.<br><br><i><h4>Sonic the Hedgehog CD</h4></i>
In Sonic the Hedgehog CD, Sonic was traveling to Never Lake to explore the Little Planet, a small satellite that goes near Earth once a year. When Sonic arrived, however, he saw that the entire planet had been transformed into a mechanical wasteland and chained to a nearby mountain. After avoiding some falling mountain debris, Sonic noticed Dr. Robotnik's face carved into the mountain where the chain was embedded; immediately he knew that his arch-nemesis was behind this and up to no good again and traveled to the Little Planet to liberate it. As he arrived, Sonic learned he could undo Robotnik's work by using Little Planet's time passages to change the past and by collecting the native Time Stones, powerful gems capable of controlling the passage of time which Robotnik had his eyes on to conquer the world.<br><br>Shortly after his arrival, Sonic met Amy Rose, who had a massive crush on him. Only shortly after their meeting though, Amy was captured by Metal Sonic, a robot created by Robotnik to destroy Sonic, leaving Sonic with the task of saving Amy too. Using his unrivaled speed, Sonic ensured a good future for the Little Planet. He eventually caught up to Metal Sonic and the doctor once again and raced Metal Sonic at Stardust Speedway with Eggman hot on his heels. While Sonic outraced his metallic doppelganger, Metal Sonic was smashed at the finishing line while Sonic saved Amy from captivity.<br><br>Sonic went on and defeated the doctor in Metallic Madness, which caused the doctor's bases to collapse. After escaping Little Planet with Amy, Sonic destroyed the chain holding the Little Planet and stood in awe as the Little Planet showed Sonic's face in a shower of light as a sign of gratitude before warping away, leaving many new flowers growing around the area. While Robotnik managed to grab a Time Stone, Sonic put an end to his schemes by destroying his escape vehicle.<br><br><i><h4>Sonic Chaos</h4></i>
In Sonic Chaos, Sonic was out on an adventure with Tails when they heard a rumor saying that Dr. Robotnik was seeking the Chaos Emeralds on South Island. Returning home, they found the island in chaos as Robotnik had stolen one of the Chaos Emeralds, thereby creating an imbalance that scattered the rest of the Chaos Emeralds and was making the island sink into the ocean. As such, Sonic and Tails set out to get the Chaos Emeralds before it was too late.<br><br>In the ensuing battles, Sonic and Tails recovered the lost Chaos Emeralds except one. Afterward, they defeated Robotnik in a final showdown and retrieved the Chaos Emerald in his possession, ensuring South Island's safety once more.<br><br><i><h4>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 & Knuckles</h4></i>
<i><h4>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</h4></i>
In Sonic the Hedgehog 3, many days after stopping the Death Egg, Sonic was napping on the beach until Tails came who had discovered a large reaction of chaos energy out on the sea. At the same time, Sonic found an ancient ring washed on the shore, which made him recall a legend about a floating island in the sky with a highly unique culture supported by a powerful stone. Filled with excitement, Sonic headed out with Tails in the Tornado for another adventure to check out the reaction.<br><br>When Sonic and Tails reached the location, they found the legendary floating isle, Angel Island, except that the island was kept at the ocean's surface by the Death Egg, which Sonic thought they had destroyed, which had crash-landed on it. Seeing that the Death Egg was currently being rebuilt, Sonic and Tails set out to destroy the Death Egg for good. Sonic used the Chaos Emeralds to transform into his Super State and stormed the island, but when he arrived, Sonic was ambushed by Knuckles the Echidna, the guardian of the floating island and the Master Emerald, who forced the emeralds out of Sonic. The echidna, who had been tricked by Dr. Robotnik into believing that Sonic and Tails had come to steal the Master Emerald, thus stole the Chaos Emeralds and escaped with them to hide them.<br><br>Despite this setback, Sonic and Tails left to liberate the island from Dr. Robotnik's robots. During their adventure, Sonic and Tails were repeatedly ambushed by Knuckles, but they got through each encounter with their lives and recovered the Chaos Emeralds as well. When reaching the Launch Base Zone, Sonic and Tails boarded the Death Egg just as it took off where they faced Robotnik, who had returned to defeat Sonic with excessive force. Nevertheless, Sonic defeated Robotnik again, with their resulting battle taking its toll on the Death Egg at a critical point of its launch, making it crash into the Lava Reef Zone.<br><br><i><h4>Sonic & Knuckles</h4></i>
In Sonic & Knuckles, as Sonic and Tails landed in the Mushroom Hill Zone after escaping the falling Death Egg, they saw the space station survive another crash landing, this time into the island's volcano. Not content unless the Death Egg was completely destroyed, Sonic set out with Tails once more to find the Death Egg and destroy it and as well discover Robotnik's fate. As the duo got through Mushroom Hill, they spotted Knuckles passing through a hidden doorway. After making sure Knuckles was gone, Sonic opened the hidden doorway and looked inside it with Tails, where they found a Giant Ring. Enthralled, Sonic touched it, which took him and Tails to the Emerald Shrine in the Hidden Palace Zone where the Master Emerald rested. Riddled with questions, Sonic and Tails returned to Mushroom Hill Zone to began the next phase of their adventure.<br><br>Eventually, the duo reached the Hidden Palace Zone on their own, where Sonic faced Knuckles in an epic showdown and won. Sonic and Tails then followed the red echidna as he went to check the Master Emerald, where they saw that Robotnik steal it for the purpose of powering the Death Egg. As the doctor escaped with the Master Emerald, Knuckles, having realized Robotnik's deceit, befriended Sonic and Tails and guided them to Sky Sanctuary Zone to reach the Death Egg, though they had to leave Knuckles behind as he was too exhausted from the previous struggles. On their way through the sanctuary, Sonic and Tails fought Eggrobo and Mecha Sonic fought several times, where they in the final encounter used a crumbling pillar to get on the Death Egg.<br><br>Onboard the Death Egg, Sonic and Tails faced Dr. Robotnik in his Great Eggman Robo for a final showdown. After the defeat of the contraption, causing the final destruction of the Death Egg, Robotnik escaped with the Master Emerald in another mech, but Sonic transformed into Super Sonic and pursued the doctor through space. After a long battle, Sonic beat Robotnik's mechs and returned to earth with the Master Emerald where Tails caught him in the Tornado. The two then brought the Master Emerald back to where it belonged. Having made peace with Knuckles, Sonic and Tails left Angel Island for the time being. Sometime after this though, Sonic rescued Knuckles in the Tornado—after the latter's fight against the recently-reactivated Mecha Sonic—from falling into the ocean. The two brought the stolen Master Emerald back to Angel Island and they parted ways once more.<br><br><i><h4>Sonic the Hedgehog Triple Trouble</h4></i>
In Sonic the Hedgehog Triple Trouble, Sonic, and Tails caught wind that Dr. Robotnik had lost the Chaos Emeralds following a weapons test and sprung into action to find them. While collected information, however, Knuckles, who had been deceived by Robotnik that they sought the Emeralds for the wrong reasons, suddenly popped up and gave them a warning before leaving. Despite their adversaries, Sonic's resolve remained unshaken.<br><br>Along their adventure, Sonic got all but one of the Chaos Emeralds while overcoming both Knuckles and Fang the Sniper, the latter who wanted the Emeralds for profit. When arriving at the Dr. Robotnik's base, Sonic and Tails faced and beat Metal Sonic, Fang and finally Robotnik for good while retrieving the final Chaos Emerald from the doctor. After that, Sonic and Tails freed Knuckles from imprisoned and made up once more, before taking off on the Tornado towards new adventures.<br><br><i><h4>Sonic Labyrinth</h4></i>
In Sonic Labyrinth, some days after Tails left on a solo adventure, Sonic awoke from a nap on South Island, but when he slipped his shoes on, he noticed that his feet felt extremely heavy. Upon examination, he noticed Dr. Robotnik's insignia on his shoes which proved irremovable. Cursing his carelessness, Sonic noticed Robotnik proclaiming to his nemesis that he had switched Sonic's Power Sneakers out with his Speed Down Boots, which disabled Sonic's speed and agility. The only thing that could remove them were the Chaos Emeralds, which Robotnik had already hidden away in his new super labyrinth on South Island. Unable to chase after the doctor, Robotnik began taking over the island. While his speed was gone, however, Sonic realized that he could still use his Spin Dash and resolved to brave this labyrinth to get back both his speed and the Emeralds.<br><br>With his Spin Dash, Sonic made his way through the labyrinth and expelled Robotnik from the island while regaining the Chaos Emeralds and his regular shoes.<br><br><i><h4>Sonic the Fighters</h4></i>
In Sonic the Fighters, Sonic learned that Dr. Robotnik had built the Death Egg II and was deploying armies of robots from it, which were laying waste to everything. Luckily, Tails had built the Lunar Fox, which he could fly directly to the new Death Egg in and destroy it. However, it was a one-seater and it needed all of the Chaos Emeralds to take off. Sonic and Tails, therefore, set off to gather the Emeralds from their friends (and enemies), who were safeguarding them, from around the globe. On their first stop, however, Sonic got into an argument with Knuckles (one of the Emerald guardians) over who would get to use the Lunar Fox, with Knuckles arguing that only the strongest among them should go. Believing he was more than qualified, Sonic accepted Knuckles's challenge, but before the hedgehog and echidna could fight, Tails got between them and convinced them to fight fair and squarely over the spot in the ring with the other Emerald guardians, and the one who could win against all the contestants got to ride the Lunar Fox. A fighting tournament was subsequently established.<br><br>At the end of the tournament, the victor used the Chaos Emeralds to go to the Death Egg II and made it self-destruct moments after escaping it.<br><br><i><h4>Sonic 3D Blast</h4></i>
In Sonic 3D Blast, Sonic traveled with Tails and Knuckles to Flicky Island. Having heard legends about the island's Flickies' being the key to find the Chaos Emeralds, the trio journeyed to there to find these birds.<br><br>Once they arrived on the island, however, they found the island in pandemonium and Dr. Robotnik nearby, busying himself with turning the Flickies into Badniks. It turned out that Robotnik had established a base on the island and was trapping the Flickies so they could power his robots and find the Chaos Emeralds on the island. As Sonic made his presence clear to Robotnik who departing in the Egg Mobile, Sonic decided to rescue the island and its inhabitants.[19] In no time, Sonic saved the Flickies on the island and, with the help of Tails and Knuckles, gathered all of the Chaos Emeralds before the doctor could do. The Flickies then helped Sonic enter Dr. Robotnik's secret lair, where Sonic beat Robotnik in a lengthy battle. Escaping the lair in time, Sonic met the Flickies who thanked him for his help and peace reigned over the island once more.<br><br><i><h4>Sonic Blast</h4></i>
In Sonic Blast, Sonic was napping on South Island when he was awoken by a light from a nearby Chaos Emerald which shattered and spread across the island. Robotnik then showed up to reveal he was planning to shoot Sonic with a laser beam but hit the Chaos Emerald instead. Still pleased with the outcome, Robotnik planned to use the shards to fortify his Silver Castle. As Sonic was about to head to find the shards, Knuckles showed up and joined him in his quest. Eventually, Sonic and Knuckles got the shards first and destroyed Robotnik's fortress.<br><br><i><h4>Sonic R</h4></i>
In Sonic R, Sonic was on an adventure with Tails when they saw an advertisement of the World Grand Prix, a racing competition to determine the fastest in the world. Despite Tails' urging, Sonic was not interested in participating, but when he glimpsed Dr. Robotnik's name on the list of participants, he changed his mind and ran off to register.<br><br>In the competition, Sonic had to face many of his friends, new and old enemies and as well Robotnik, who planned to use Sonic to locate the Chaos Emeralds which were on the race tracks. In the end, Sonic kept his title as the fastest thing alive while he and the others kept Dr. Robotnik from the Chaos Emeralds.<br><br><i><h4>Sonic Adventure</h4></i>
In Sonic Adventure, Sonic was just returning home through Station Square after being gone for a while on a long journey where he saw the Station Square Police Department fighting Chaos. Sonic stepped and defeated Chaos, though it escaped. The next day, Sonic saw Tails' crash in his plane nearby and came to his aid. The fox took Sonic to see a plane he was working on, powered by a Chaos Emerald, but at the workshop, Dr. Eggman appeared to take the Emerald. Though the duo beat Eggman and his Egg Hornet, Eggman snatched the Chaos Emerald and revealed Chaos, whom he transformed into Chaos 1 with the Emerald and told his plan to make it invincible with all seven Chaos Emeralds and then build Robotnikland upon Station Square. As Eggman fled, Sonic set out with Tails to get the Chaos Emeralds before Dr. Eggman.<br><br>Sonic and Tails soon got two Emeralds, only for Eggman to briefly knock them out with sleeping gas and steal one. Unshaken, Sonic and Tails soon found another Chaos Emerald, when they were attacked by Knuckles, who had been tricked by Eggman into believing Sonic had Master Emerald Shards. Sonic fought Knuckles until he dropped the Chaos Emeralds, which were then taken by Eggman and given to Chaos 2, transforming it into Chaos 4. After Sonic and the others beat it, Eggman escaped to his Egg Carrier. Sonic and Tails tried followed him in the Tornado, but were shot down. Back on the ground, Sonic began looking for Tails but met Amy who wanted him to her protect a Flickey. Despite Sonic refusing, Amy followed him until they were attacked by ZERO, who soon kidnapped Amy. Sonic followed them as ZERO fled to the Egg Carrier until he reached a dead end, but then met Tails in the Tornado 2 who got them onboard the Egg Carrier. When they found Amy with Eggman however, Sonic was attacked by E-102 Gamma, but before Sonic could destroy Gamma, Amy convinced him to let it go. As the Egg Carrier began to crash, Sonic had Tails get Amy to safety while he followed Eggman.<br><br>Eventually, Sonic found Eggman with Chaos 6, just as Big the Cat showed up to save Froggy who was trapped inside Chaos. After saving Froggy, Sonic defeated Chaos 6, but as Eggman escaped, Knuckles showed up, whom Sonic left Chaos to while he followed Eggman. On the way, Sonic found an ancient temple with a mural depicting a monster on the inside and a mysterious light that took him back in time to see the Altar of the Emeralds in ruins and Tikal trying to stop a catastrophe. Back in the present, Sonic found Eggman and beat him for good before reuniting with Tails again.<br><br>While trying to rest, Sonic had to head out when Tails reported that Angel Island had fallen. There, they found both Knuckles and Eggman, and learned that Chaos was still alive, had rebelled against Eggman to destroy the world, and possessed six Chaos Emeralds. As they were heading out get the last Emerald before Chaos, Sonic was drawn into the past again, where he saw the Knuckles Clan's attack on the altar and Tikal sealing herself and Chaos inside the Master Emerald. Back in the present, Sonic and Tails found the Chaos Emerald in the Tornado 2, but lost it to Chaos, who became Perfect Chaos and attacked Station Square. As Perfect Chaos destroys the Egg Carrier 2, Tikal came to Sonic to explain that Chaos was blinded by wrath. After Perfect Chaos released the drained Chaos Emeralds, Tikal wanted to seal Chaos again, but Sonic said it would not work as Chaos would still be full of rage. Sonic's friends then came with the Chaos Emeralds, claiming that he could still use their positive energy. Transforming into Super Sonic, Sonic defeated Perfect Chaos while neutralizing its anger. As Chaos and Tikal departed, Sonic noticed Eggman making his escape and decided to head off himself for his next adventure.<br><br>Sonic the Hedgehog Pocket Adventure</h4></i>
In Sonic the Hedgehog Pocket Adventure, Sonic discovered Dr. Eggman was up to his old tricks again by capturing Animals, and set out to foil him. While chasing Eggman, Sonic had several confrontations with the doctor, who managed to give Sonic the slip each time. Eventually though, Sonic came across Knuckles, who suddenly attacked him. Upon defeating Knuckles and claiming his Chaos Emerald, however, Eggman ambushed the two heroes. Taking the Emerald, Eggman left Sonic and Knuckles to get crushed by the collapsing cave they were in. With his last strength, however, Knuckles sent Sonic out of the cave and into the sky with an uppercut.<br><br>Among the clouds, Sonic landed on the wings of the passing Tornado, flown by Tails. With Tails' aid, Sonic reached Eggman's airbase and resumed his hunt for Eggman.

He later saw Eggman captured in his own "spiky rodent trap" by Emerl and Cream on-screen, and headed out to pick them up.<br><br>Sonic later met Shadow again and thought he wanted to capture Emerl, but heard that it was not his intention. Shadow informed Sonic that Emerl only needed one more Chaos Emerald to awake his full power, which would destroy the world, but Sonic believed Emerl would not do that since he had a heart like Shadow, who was also a top-secret ultimate weapon.

However, Eggman was unable to control Emerl as expected, and Emerl prepared to fire the Final Egg Blaster at Earth. As the Master Emerald then appeared, Sonic went to the Death Egg with it, hoping to neutralize Emerl's power, but Emerl smashed the Master Emerald. Tails then told Sonic that he could stop Emerl by damaging him, but it would destroy him. With a heavy heart, Sonic engaged Emerl in battle and defeated him with his full strength.<br><br>As Emerl began to say farewell, Sonic, in a rare chase of emotional denial, tried to assure Emerl everything would be fine, only for Emerl to disappear.

After having tracked and lost the pirates at Haunted Ship, freeing the Vikings on Blizzard Peaks from the pirates' captivity and uncovering the secrets of Sky Babylon, the group found the pirates’ hideout in some ancient ruins. Before heading there however, Sonic, Tails, and Blaze decided to make Marine stay behind as she could endanger the mission. While Sonic and Tails tried to be gentle about it, they silently agreed with Blaze when she told Marine she was a nuisance, making her run off crying.<br><br>At the pirates’ hideout, Sonic faced Whisker and Johnny alongside Blaze. Despite beating them, however, Whisker escaped and Sonic and his friends saw Marine arriving and going after the pirates, only to get caught by the Ghost Titan. Fortunately, Sonic came up with a plan to distract Whisker by letting Tails pretend the scepter was somewhere else while he and Blaze saved Marine. Sonic and Blaze then destroyed the Ghost Titan together and escaped, while the pirates went down with their ship. Seeing Marine had reclaimed the Jeweled Scepter, the group headed back to Southern Island.<br><br>After collecting all seven Chaos Emeralds and Sol Emeralds, Sonic and Tails planned to return home, but learned that the Jeweled Scepter had been stolen again. In the wake of an earthquake, the thieves revealed themselves to be Dr. Eggman and Dr. Eggman Nega in the Egg Wizard, who were behind the pirates, so they could use the Jeweled Scepter's incredible power to build Eggmanland upon both worlds. As Sonic and the gang pursued the Eggmans to Deep Core, the villains tapped into the Power of the Stars with the scepter, but Sonic and Blaze used the Emeralds to become Super Sonic and Burning Blaze. As they were about to defeat the Egg Wizard, however, Eggman Nega tried to destroy them and the world, but Marine distracted them, allowing Sonic and Blaze to destroy the Egg Wizard.<br><br>Letsshake<br><br>Sonic shakes hands with Blaze once more.<br><br>The next morning, Tails constructed a vessel for him and Sonic to return home in. Just before Sonic could leave, Blaze suggested that the Sol Emeralds and the Chaos Emeralds were responsible for their reunion, which Sonic remarked that they could never know for sure, before he shook hands with Blaze once more. As Sonic and Tails were taking off, Marine arrived in her SS Super-Marine to say goodbye. Sonic and Tails then promised Marine they would see each other again and headed back to their own world.<br><br>Sonic Riders seriesEdit<br><br>Sonic RidersEdit<br><br>Sonic vs Jet Riders<br><br>Sonic facing Jet for the first time.<br><br>In Sonic Riders, Team Sonic arrived at Future City to search for a Chaos Emerald, when they saw the Babylon Rogues. Tails read on his radar that they had the Emerald and Sonic ran off to intercept them. After Knuckles knocked Storm off his Type-S, Sonic chased after Jet on the Type-S, but was blown off the Extreme Gear by Jet and the Babylon Rogues escaped. Regardless, Sonic was excited to have found new competition.<br><br>The next day, Team Sonic saw Dr. Eggman announcing the EX World Grand Prix and that the entry fee for the contestants was a Chaos Emerald, with the winner getting to claim all seven. Sonic was initially suspicious, but when he saw that the participants Dr. Eggman had found were the Babylon Rogues, he decided to enter the competition.<br><br>After the qualifications rounds, Sonic was with his team when he met Amy, who also signed up for the tournament, much to his discomfort. After hearing Tails' explanation about the legends of the Babylon Rogues and Babylon Garden, the group met Wave the Swallow who mocked Tails' Blue Star (and placed a bomb on it), leaving Sonic annoyed by her behavior. No sooner though, Sonic and the other hurried to next race.<br><br>As Sonic made it to the semifinals, he took time off to practice his Extreme Gear skill with his team when they were interrupted by Jet, who mocked Sonic before leaving. While angered, Sonic did not believe he should underestimate Jet. Tails then began to doubt the Blue Star he had made for Sonic, but Sonic told him not to worry.<br><br>When Sonic and his team got to the finals, Sonic vowed to a taunting Jet that he would not to lose. When Sonic was about to win the race, Wave detonated the bomb under Sonic’s Blue Star, causing him to lose to Jet, much to Sonic's anger. Sonic and the others the saw Jet claim and use the seven Chaos Emeralds in tandem with the Key to Babylon Garden to reveal Babylon Garden itself, with the intention of claiming its treasure. Eggman, however, stole the key so that he could take the treasure for himself, believing it to be technology that he could use to conquer the world. Calling his team, Sonic headed out to stop Eggman. Using the Tornado 2, Team Sonic arrived at Babylon Garden, where Sonic received the Blue Star II from Tails and went after Eggman on it. On the way however, he was pitted again Jet, who was after Eggman too, and Sonic raced against Jet to Eggman as a rematch.<br><br>Jet and Sonic part ways<br><br>Jet and Sonic part ways.<br><br>Sonic eventually beat Jet and cornered Dr. Eggman, but stopped when Eggman showed that he held Amy hostage. Sonic, however, dived into Eggman (and Amy) and blew them away when Eggman looked away. Sonic then took back the Key to Babylon Garden and handed it back to the Rouges despite Jet's refusal. As the Rogues went to claim the treasure, Sonic decided to leave, but Amy, furious at him for endangering her, chased after him with her Piko Piko Hammer. No sooner, Sonic and the others heard a roar from inside Babylon Garden and went to check it out. There, they saw the Babylon Rogues had awoken the Babylon Guardian and were forced to fight it. After beating the guardian, Sonic, Jet and the rest found the Treasure of Babylon, which turned out to be a Magic Carpet, much to the disappointment of Eggman. With the whole ordeal over and with their rivalry more friendly, Sonic promised Jet that he would be ready to race him again the next </div>

<p>
The Superhero Database Classification number, or SHDB Class, is a number that represents the overall 'power' of a character. All traits of a character are used for calculating the Classification.
</p>
<h5>What it DOESN'T mean</h5>
<p>
This doesn't mean that a higher class would always beat a lower class character. But the bigger the difference in Class is, the more obvious it is who'll win in a fight.
</p>
<h5>How is this calculated</h5>
<pre class="footnote">( INT^1.3 + (STR*0.5 )^2 + (SPE*0.5)^2 + DUR^1.6 + (POW + (SPS*SPL))^2 + COM^1.8 ) ^ TIER</pre>
<h6>Super Power Score and Level</h6>
<p>Every Super Power has a score (SPS) that is used to calculate the Class. Each Super Power also has 3 levels (SPL). The level is set when connecting that Super Power to a character. The level determines the final score, of the Super Power, being used in the calculation.
