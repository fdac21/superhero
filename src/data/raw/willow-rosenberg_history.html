<h3>Willow Rosenberg's History</h3>
<strong>Willow Danielle Rosenberg</strong> was a witch native to Sunnydale, California, a founding member of the Scooby Gang, and the best friend and semi-official sidekick of the Slayer, Buffy Summers. Willow started out as a shy computer nerd, eventually developing her talents to become a powerful and assertive witch.<br><br>Willow was introduced to the forces of magic by attempting a complex spell to re-ensoul Angel. To her own surprise, Willow tapped into considerable power during this ritual and would come to practice witchcraft. Willow was quick to grasp basic spells and with support from her girlfriend Tara Maclay, her powers blossomed even more rapidly as did her self-confidence. Milestones in her magical career include the enjoining spell, taking on the hell-goddess Glory and surviving, resurrecting Buffy Summers, nearly ending the world, activating multiple Potential Slayers and, eventually, establishing herself as Earth's most powerful witch. <br><br><strong><h4>Early life</h4></strong>
Willow Rosenberg was born to Sheila and Ira Rosenberg. Her mother was supercilious and distant, noticing Willow had cut her hair months after she actually had it cut. She had a "bad birthday party pony thing" when she was four, leaving her with a fear of ponies and horses. At some point, Willow also developed a fear of frogs and spiders. After watching Snoopy on Ice, her dad took her backstage, but she was scared and threw up on Woodstock.<br><br>Willow became best friends with Alexander Harris at a young age and she attended school with him throughout all of her life. On the first day of kindergarten, Willow cried because she broke a yellow crayon. She and Xander also gained another friend, Jesse McNally. Willow was also very close friends with Amy Madison during junior high.<br><br><strong><h4>Sunnydale High</h4></strong>
In her early years in high school, Willow was a shy, naive "nerd" with a light, risqu√© sense of humor. A member of the math, science, and computer clubs, she was the go-to person for tutoring help. Willow was ridiculed by her more popular classmates, including cheerleaders Cordelia Chase and Harmony Kendall. She had a hopeless crush on her lifelong friend Xander, who ignored her to pursue his equally hopeless crush on a new student and their eventual mutual best friend, Buffy Summers.<br><br>After witnessing Willow being insulted by Cordelia, Buffy quickly approached Willow as a friend despite Willow responding in fear as she saw her with Cordelia. The two met at the Bronze and Buffy encouraged Willow to seize her day, so she went out with a boy she had just met, Thomas, actually a vampire. Willow soon became Buffy's best friend after the Slayer saved her, leading Willow along with Xander to learn about Buffy's secret identity. This revelation led Willow to dedicate herself to aiding her friend in the battle against evil. Willow's assistance to the Scooby Gang was mostly through her computing and hacking skills as well as helping the school librarian and Buffy's Watcher Rupert Giles on researching about demons.<br><br> <br><br>By the end of her sophomore year, Willow's interest in computers got her almost killed by the demon Moloch the Corruptor, who pretended to be a teenage boy talking to her on the net. Willow initially ignored her friends' warnings but came to realize his true nature when he revealed himself in his new robotic form. After Buffy killed him, Willow felt bad for falling for a demon, thinking something was wrong with her. Buffy and Xander cheered her up by reminding her of the times they fell for someone out of the norm.<br><br>She also witnessed the death of several students at the hands of the Order of Aurelius, affecting her emotionally. This experience gave Buffy the push to confront the Order's leader, the Master who was prophesied to kill her. Learning this, Willow met up with Giles, Xander and Jennifer Calendar, her computer science teacher and technopagan she admired. They believed that a swarm of the Master's vampire minions would assemble at the Bronze where the school's prom was currently being held. Willow accompanied Jenny to her car where they discovered that the vampires were actually going to the school where they were. Luckily, Cordelia arrived and rescued them with her car, having been helped the gang prior. Returning to the library, Willow fought off both vampires and a tentacle monster that spawned from the Hellmouth, awakened by the Master after he bit Buffy and left her to drown. Buffy, however, was revived by CPR and came to their need and killed the Master.<br><br><strong>Character Development</strong>
In her junior year, Willow began to have huge advances to her persona. During Halloween when everyone literally became what their costumes were from Ethan Rayne's Costume Shop, Buffy and Xander were given different mind-sets, leaving the ghostly Willow to take initiative and assign for Giles' help while wearing skimpy outfit that Buffy before hence encouraged her to put on to impress Xander, though she kept it hidden a ghost costume that she abandoned while becoming a ghost. Also, when Buffy lied to Giles so she could hold off her slayer duties to attend a college frat party, Willow burst out in a fit of guilt yet also judging Giles for not allowing Buffy to have time for herself and Angel for not bothering to make time for her.<br><br>After discovering Xander's relationship with Cordelia when she caught them kissing, a heartbroken Willow angrily expressed her shock and disgust that Xander would involve himself with someone like Cordelia before her, further strengthening her assertiveness and pride.<br><br>She then quickly decided to move on, starting a romantic relationship with Daniel "Oz" Osbourne, a guitarist in the local band Dingoes Ate My Baby. The two began talking after they were selected by the "world's leading software concern" during the Careers Fair. She later invited him to Buffy's birthday where he witnessed his first vampire being staked. Even after the revelation that he was a werewolf and almost getting killed by him, Willow still continued to date him, even confidently kissing him at her own accord. <br><br><h4><strong>Early witchcraft</h4></strong>
At first, Willow's major "powers" were her intelligence and computer skills, as well as a marked snarkiness. She aided Giles when he researched information to aid Buffy in overcoming various challenges. Willow also aided in the preparation of magical materials, making her first potion to detect a witch and performing the ritual to revoke Angelus' invitation to Buffy's house, but did not seriously begin practicing magic until the death of Jenny Calendar, one of her teachers. She was asked to take over teaching the class because of her high aptitude, and one day came across a floppy disk holding the Ritual of Restoration that Jenny had successfully translated to English. Though for months she believed that the ritual didn't work, Willow learned that the Ritual of Restoration was successful and performing it initiated her interest in magic.<br><br><h4>Advancing</h4>
Willow's first major spell involved re-cursing Angel with a soul, a feat she later repeated years later. She learned to levitate a pencil early in her senior year, using it to stake a vampire through his heart, and her powers continued to develop until she was casting powerful spells first independently and then with the help of Tara Maclay. Soon she surpassed Tara, a more experienced witch, in skill and was able to draw enough power to even hurt the powerful hell god, Glory. Willow demonstrated the ability to bring Buffy back to life, leaving her drained but she regained her magic in a few hours. Her friend Amy introduced her to a warlock, Rack, who gave her the ability to last longer and cast spells of more power which led Willow further down the path to the dark side of magic. Eventually, after Tara died, the magic consumed Willow and she nearly destroyed the world. At the time, Anya assumed Willow was the most powerful Wicca in the Western Hemisphere.<br><br><strong><h4>Dark Willow</strong></h4>
Willow was capable of flying, absorbing life and magic from others, teleportation, being impervious to physical damage, healing herself and others instantly at will, unleashing powerful energy blasts, locating people and objects at a distance (even when theoretically protected from such spells), emitting high-pitched shrieks in frequencies harmful to human ears, and exerting powerful levels of telekinesis and telepathic mind control. This mind control even extended to Anya, despite Anya's statement that vengeance demons were immune to mind-controlling magic. Additionally, she proved more than capable of going head-to-head against Buffy in a physical fight after casting a strength-enhancing spell on herself, able to show impressive strength as well as fighting skills though it should be noted that Buffy was holding back and before a decisive outcome could come about, Willow used magic. It is also interesting to note that even before she went dark, the immense amount of grief she dealt with affected her powers immensely, as seen with how she banished the deity Osiris with just a scream filled with anguish. Willow also caused most of the light bulbs in the Magic Box to short circuit and paralyzed Anya, who recently regained her powers, with a simple command. Finally, she was able to cast extremely powerful spells, as she single-handedly almost brought upon an apocalypse by attempting to channel the power of the Earth and focusing it on Proserpexa's effigy to burn the world to a cinder, which was only averted by the timely intervention of Xander.<br><br><strong><h4>Return of Dark Willow</h4></strong>
During her time in Quor'toth with Angel, Faith, and Connor, Willow once again went dark, her veins protruding, her eyes gone black and the power inside her was made manifest in the form of dark energies circling around her in flight. At first, she was reluctant in using her powers, but once she let her dark side take over, she unleashed massive blasts of immense magical power towards the Old One, Quor'toth. Her own power easily matches that of the primordial demon. To defeat the monster, albeit temporarily, she used her powers to telekinetically lift a mountain from the surrounding area and drop it on the Old One. Before she could do any more lasting damage, Angel intervened, reverting the witch to her stable state.<br><br><strong><h4>Post-darkness</h4></strong>
Her willingness to use magic was greatly diminished after her experience as Dark Willow. Willow spent time at a coven in England with Giles where she developed a better understanding of magic, balance, etc. At that point, she was so powerful her very feelings and thoughts could cause some sort of effect. Amy commented that other practitioners worked "twice as hard to be half as good" as Willow. Despite this, Willow was largely prevented from accessing more than slight magic by the First Evil, who attempted to corrupt her at each spell. Examples of the controlled usage of her power were her use of telekinesis to practice self-restraint, conjuring force fields, extensive telepathic conversations, opening a portal, and exerting hypnotic control. Willow also commented that she absorbed power from the things around her, one time-draining some of Kennedy's life-force. When Willow came to the aid of Angel Investigations, she displayed a great capacity for casting powerful spells, such as the Ritual of Restoration and Delothrian's Arrow, consecutively without any strain. She was also able to defeat "Cordelia" (possessed by Jasmine at the time) who was trying to stop her from restoring Angel's soul, casting "Cordelia" out of her mind and defending herself effectively. Willow cast a spell that imbued multiple Potential Slayers on Earth with Slayer powers (formerly reserved for only one girl in every generation), temporarily turning Willow's hair white in the process. Kennedy remarked on it by calling her "a goddess."<br><br><h4>After Aluwyn</h4>
Willow's powers greatly expanded since she returned from her time being mentored by the Saga Vasuki in the high witching arts. Even before she underwent her tutelage, she has shown great prowess with her magic, defeating Gnog, one of Aluwyn's cohorts, in a blinding burst of magical energies without hurting him significantly. Since returning from her time with Aluwyn, she could fly by force of will and regained control of her powers, and although her roots continued to go dark whenever she tapped into more power, this didn't faze her. She has acquired the ability to absorb an opponent's magic in order to decode it. It was at this period where she would typically, but not frequently, use binding spells as offensive magics have her tap into more power, which was something she was still generally apprehensive about at the time. During her battle with Amy, she referred to Willow as a "big all-powerful earth mother witch goddess." Xander has once called her Elphaba, the name of the Wicked Witch of the West in the novel and musical Wicked. She can also cast powerful summoning spells. She was able to project vast amounts of energy from her fingertips and cast aside powerful spells. She was able to heal herself rapidly from extreme injuries, at least including partial lobotomy. She was also able to heal injuries in others, though having a lack in power could only do so much in that case. She was also able to cast complex spells consecutively without showing any considerable strain, which is best demonstrated when she tried to pinpoint the location of Giles, Andrew, and Faith and teleported to three different locations in such a short amount of time without experiencing any form of physical fatigue or loss of control. She became capable of casting powerful teleportation spells that bypass enchantments preventing such spells from being cast and can even take others with her, dispelling possessions and powerful enough to knock back multiple demons with sheer telekinetic force. On two occasions she demonstrated the ability to channel part of her power through Buffy; once to help her overcome Amy and rescue Willow and again to tag-team the demon Sephrilian.<br><br>When Willow connected with the Seed of Wonder, she became so powerful that she was able to fight a whole array of demons from different dimensions, conjuring massive tree roots with little effort that impale airborne targets and consuming multiple opponents in fires she conjured with willpower alone. However, Buffy destroyed the Seed, disconnecting this world from magic, preventing Willow from fighting any longer. Willow was rendered powerless, unable to perform any magic. <br><br><h4>Traversing the multiverse</h4>
Willow grew frustrated and worried for the world without magic and theorized she would have access to her powers again if she could travel to another dimension. She was able to channel the residual magic in Buffy's scythe in conjunction with Angel's son Connor to access the hell dimension Quor'toth. While there, the magical power drastically changed but enabled her to cast bolts of energy and various enchantments though of considerably lesser appeal than her previous Earth magic. Despite what she went through to get used to the magic in Quor'toth, she was capable of releasing bolts of electricity, blasting demons with streams of powerful magic, break open sealed doors and erect powerful barriers that can even withstand Quor'toth's power. She was even able to subdue the Old One temporarily by unleashing bolts of immense magical power fueled by her intense longing for power. When she went dark in the hell dimension, she was able to match the power of the Old One Quor'toth with extremely powerful magic and temporarily defeat it by dropping a mountain on it. She was also initially speculated to be immune to the corrupting effects of Quor'toth, though it was revealed that it was not the case, as Willow herself said that the hell dimension is affecting her, pulling her further into the darkness she was so afraid of.<br><br>After arriving in Wonderland she showcased her true power completely, detailing an intricate and elaborate understanding of magic and witchcraft. She was able to cast powerful magic such as the Prey Inversion spell and the Visigoth Pyre spell, without showing excessive strain despite casting them consecutively. Upon meeting Aluwyn's coven, she was praised as the most powerful witch of the Earth dimension, and by Saga Vasuki herself as a battle witch. When combining her power with Saga Vasuki, she was made capable of even more powerful magic, similar to how she once united with Tara to perform spells. She was able to banish a large sea creature alongside Aluwyn without hurting it.<br><br>After overcoming her fear of her powers, Willow began to perform spells of immense power, molding the sand around the Liminals in her own image to attack for her, easily going toe-to-toe with the dark warlock Rack before he obtained the Scythe, near split-second teleportation, casting aside offensive magics thrown at her, and releasing explosions capable of leveling large mounds of land. Following interaction with a sentient universe that represents magic, she regained her powers, also allowing her to restore the "magic" in other Earth-bound beings just by approaching them. Dark Willow was the most powerful Big Bad in the Buffyverse<br><br><h4>Powers restored</h4>
After returning to Earth, she was able to easily heal a scar on Buffy's forehead. However, her magic was revealed to have become limited due to her drawing on her internal energies instead of the external powers. Though still capable of elaborate and complex spells of significant power, such as awakening a comatose Dawn and giving her more lifeforce to last longer in a magicless world, she has a limit to what she can muster up, and exceeding such a limit results in an explosion of magical energy. However, this seems to only apply with regards to the magic she can give to others, as she is seen to still be able to cast extremely destructive spells without being drained. During the battle of the Deeper Well, she displayed a great capacity for magical combat yet again and was able to go toe to toe with multiple God-class Demons and Mystics who remained in the Dimension. She was able to fly to great heights, survive a fall from a substantial distance in the sky, ward mystical blasts away with magical will alone, blow apart multiple demons with blasts of powerful magical energies and cause single, larger demons to combust. Her willingness to tap into her Dark Magic has also increased, her going dark in an instant without hesitation. <br><br>Willow's new magical abilities were apparently lost when she birthed to a new Seed of Wonder in the Deeper Well, her magic manifesting a new Seed that would save Earth from its immediate fate and eventually restore magic to Earth full-time, the creation of the Seed apparently depriving Willow of all of her pre-existing powers.<br><br>Despite having no powers, Willow was still capable of using a magician's staff to escape the Deeper Well before it exploded in an immense burst of magical power. However, once Severin and Illyria restored the Seed of Wonder, Willow's magic came back at full strength. The first spell she attempted since regaining her magic was to fully restore Dawn's body, a feat that she was able to achieve success.<br><br><h4>New rules</h4>
Despite the fact that Willow regained her powers, she still has a difficult time using them to their fullest potential without consequences. She cannot traverse long distances within a barrier she conjured using powerful magic without causing the barrier itself to go down. She is capable of teleportation, unaided flight, projecting blasts of energy powerful enough to vanquish vampires in one hit, force field projection, and releasing pulses of telekinetic power. Apparently, the reason why Willow could not use her powers to fullest is that the Seed of Wonder is still in the process of maturing, as the process for it to take root was rushed by a surge of immense power that came from the Deeper Well and the energies that the Siphon absorbed. Despite this setback, she is still an effective combatant. However, it has been shown that because the laws of magic have been changed, Willow seems to have no need to recite any incantation to cast a spell. She was able to transform holy water into mist and conjure a couple of flowers without chanting an incantation, and even speaking gibberish on the latter. Willow was not powerful enough to take on Maloker by herself (a stark contrast to how she fared against Quor'toth, though the circumstances were clearly different), but despite the instability of Earth's magic, she managed to enlarge Dawn to gigantic proportions which played a big part in taking the primordial demon down. It is also interesting to note that Willow has truly overcome her dark side and can now willingly go "Dark Willow" whenever the good magics she normally utilizes do not seem to work, as she temporarily took down a vengeful demon with a grudge against the Slayer with dark, unbridled energies. <br><br>Distant future<br><br>When Buffy traveled nearly two hundred years into the future, she discovered that Willow was alive and youthful hundreds of years into the future, and had once again gone "dark," though she was unable to cast spells of much power. </div>

<p>
The Superhero Database Classification number, or SHDB Class, is a number that represents the overall 'power' of a character. All traits of a character are used for calculating the Classification.
</p>
<h5>What it DOESN'T mean</h5>
<p>
This doesn't mean that a higher class would always beat a lower class character. But the bigger the difference in Class is, the more obvious it is who'll win in a fight.
</p>
<h5>How is this calculated</h5>
<pre class="footnote">( INT^1.3 + (STR*0.5 )^2 + (SPE*0.5)^2 + DUR^1.6 + (POW + (SPS*SPL))^2 + COM^1.8 ) ^ TIER</pre>
<h6>Super Power Score and Level</h6>
<p>Every Super Power has a score (SPS) that is used to calculate the Class. Each Super Power also has 3 levels (SPL). The level is set when connecting that Super Power to a character. The level determines the final score, of the Super Power, being used in the calculation.
