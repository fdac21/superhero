<h3>Neferpitou's History</h3>
Neferpitou (ネフェルピトー, Neferupitō), nicknamed Pitou (ピトー, Pitō), was a cat-humanoid Chimera Ant and the firstborn of the Chimera Ant King's three Royal Guards.<br><br>Neferpitou first appears when Rammot and Peggy look for the missing rare prey, Pokkle, in the Chimera Ant nest in NGL. Rammot, having acquired Nen after being attacked with it and beginning to fantasize about seizing power, suddenly feels Neferpitou's frightening aura. Attracted by their conversation, Neferpitou enters the room, their aura alone stumping Rammot's ambition. They smell life hidden under a pile of bones, discovering Pokkle. Neferpitou prods his brain with what appears to be knitting needles to extract information about Nen. They have Rammot try Water Divination first, then they take the test as well. The leaf withers away, revealing them as a Specialist. Neferpitou then introduces themself and orders that Pokkle be fed to the Queen. They organize a "conferment ceremony" in which Squadron Leaders and Officers are to be struck by Rammot to open their Aura Nodes. As Neferpitou thinks to themself that it must be tough to be ordinary and have to go to such lengths to acquire power, someone triggers their En.<br><br>Neferpitou leaves Peggy in charge and heads out to test their power. They glimpse Kite, Gon, and Killua in the distance. With a single leap, they reach them and sever Kite's right arm. Neferpitou ignores Killua as he drags an unconscious Gon away and focuses on Kite. When the latter conjures his Crazy Slots, Neferpitou delights in the possibilities granted by Nen. Neferpitou battles and kills Kite. Sitting under a tree with his head on their lap, they command the Ants in the nest to prepare a large freezing chamber to preserve their "collection" and comment they are quite powerful.<br><br>Having enjoyed the duel, Neferpitou sits longingly in front of Kite's corpse and wishes to fight him again. They thus create an ability to "fix" him. The reanimated corpse is used by the other Ants as a training tool. That night, Isaac Netero observes Neferpitou sitting on top of the nest and wonders if they could be stronger than him.A group of non-living things enters the range of their En. While they muse about their course of action, Shaiapouf appears and divines their thoughts, leading Neferpitou to wonder if they were thinking out loud. The newborn Royal Guard recommends waiting and informs Neferpitou that Menthuthuyoupi will awaken shortly. Neferpitou thinks Shaiapouf is weird, which, having guessed their thoughts again, the other Ant acknowledges.<br><br>When Netero, Morel, and Knov begin to wipe out the squadrons sent out to gather food, Colt and Peggy ask for their advice. Engrossed in their research in a chemistry lab, Neferpitou leaves the two of them in charge of outside dealings, stating the Royal Guards will defend the nest. They greet Menthuthuyoupi when he is born. When the King is born, the Royal Guards' alliance shifts to him. Neferpitou informs him a meal has been prepared for him and that his wish shall be their command. As they head to the roof, Colt asks Neferpitou to heal the Queen, who was mutilated during the birth of the King. Neferpitou refuses on the grounds that they had a use for Kite, but none for the Queen. Noticing the King's disappointment with the food, Neferpitou says they do not use any seasonings. Understanding the King is referring to prey capable of using Nen, the Royal Guards escort him as he looks for some.<br><br>The King kills two farmers, but their taste is not to his liking. Neferpitou informs him that the most delicious part of humans is their brain, and as such, it would be better not to damage it. They clap when the King kills a human child without harming their head. Despite recognizing the taste is better, the King is still not satisfied. Neferpitou tries to tell him that Gyo can be used to identify rare prey, but the King, feeling insulted, cuts them off with a tail strike to the face. Neferpitou asks for their forgiveness and the King commends them for their strength, as he attacked with the intent to kill.<br><br>The Royal Guards escort the King to the Royal Palace of East Gorteau. Once inside, the King stops Neferpitou before they can tell him the soldier in front of them is a rare.Neferpitou notices his aura increase after he consumes the soldier, and they conclude the King's ability is to absorb the aura of the Nen users he eats. They then give him advice on how to herd humans. When he kills Ming Jol-ik, Neferpitou decides to reassemble his body and control it to manipulate the citizens of the Republic of East Gorteau. Neferpitou then uses their ability on several members of the military. Under the guise of Ming Jol-ik, they order all citizens of the nation to gather in the capital, where the Ants will forcibly try to awaken them to Nen in order to gather high-quality food as well as to give the King an army to conquer the world. The process, called "Selection", is expected to take the lives of 5 million people.Contrary to the expectations of the Extermination Team members, Neferpitou begins the Selection as soon as the citizens begin to mobilize, starting from the western border. They succeed in producing about 5,000 Nen users, who are put into cocoons by Shaiapouf. However, they amount to only 20% of the planned quota, as someone has been disabling Neferpitou's puppets.<br><br>Neferpitou wonders if they should head out to stop him or if he is a decoy and request Shaiapouf's advice. The other Royal Guard dismisses the assassin as a mere decoy, to which Neferpitou objects he is being careful not to get caught, so he might not be trying to lure them out. They thus entrust the matter to Leol's Squad, the leader and Officers of which have sworn fealty to the King in return for Nen abilities. Since they are unable to use telepathy, Neferpitou gives them a phone to update them on the assassin's location. After they leave, Menthuthuyoupi asks if they can be trusted. Neferpitou replies they cannot, but since they are trying to earn their trust, they can be useful until they attempt to betray them. To obstruct the assassin, Neferpitou has Ming Jol-ik place the country under martial law and warn the populace against dissidents.<br><br>Neferpitou informs Leol that the assassin has defeated an infantry battalion in Luonton and, based on a hunch, tells him to prepare an ambush north of the city. Menthuthuyoupi interjects the military is not enough, to which Neferpitou replies they are just stalling him, as he has been on the move for 30 hours. Killua's actions, however, convince Morel and Knov to intervene as well. The former spreads his "Smoke Troopers" all over the capital, forcing Neferpitou to relocate their puppets there and stop the remote Selection. Neferpitou tasks Leol with terminating the intruders. The former Squadron Leader requests help, and Neferpitou agrees to send Welfin and Bloster on the condition that Leol complete his mission quickly, as the King might want to head out himself when he is done playing board games, whereas the Royal Guards would rather he stayed safe in the palace until the Selection begins in the capital.<br><br>Unexpectedly, the King rips off his own arm while playing Gungi with Komugi. Neferpitou is forced to deactivate their puppets and En to activate Doctor Blythe and treat him. Shaiapouf takes over guard duty while, unbeknownst to them, Knov sneaks into the palace to set up some portals. When the operation is completed, Neferpitou reactivates their puppets and En and perceive the presence of Palm, who infiltrated the palace by tricking Bizeff. The woman stabs herself, but, intrigued by her aura, Neferpitou saves them. They and Shaiapouf make her into a new type of human-Ant hybrid where they attempt to sever the connection between her memories and her emotional responses.<br><br>Neferpitou returns to their post. Welfin reports Leol's death and that the soldiers Neferpitou senses are made out of smoke. The Royal Guard itches to fight, but recognizes they cannot leave their post.That night, the King summons his Royal Guards, bothered by his lack of a name. Neferpitou recommends he choose a name for himself. Recounting that Komugi awakened to Nen as they played, the King enquirers what would have happened to her if she had gone through the Selection, to which Neferpitou replies that, due to her low combat potential, she would have died. After the King leaves to kill her, Neferpitou listens to Shaiapouf's concerns about the girl and concedes the King has changed since she came. Through their En, they feel her being attacked by a hawk, but they do not intervene.<br><br>The rally of citizens finally reaches the capital. While conferring with the other Royal Guards, Neferpitou perceives the presence of new enemies. The Royal Guards are concerned about an ambush during the Sorting, which the King himself intends to take part in. By exclusion, Shaiapouf is chosen to keep watch over him discreetly. The enemies Neferpitou felt disappear, causing them to believe they used Zetsu and slipped among the crowd. The King calls on Neferpitou and asks them if they knew Komugi was being attacked the night before and orders them to take action if she were threatened again.<br><br>That evening, Neferpitou smiles as the King strikes Menthuthuyoupi, giggling as all three Royal Guards have been hit by him. The Royal Guard relays to Neferpitou the King's order to shut off their En. Unwilling to take down security, Neferpitou talks to the King in person, suggesting they form a hole around the King, so he will not be distracted by their aura. The King refuses, as he would be required to either stay in one place or be continuously watched. He commands Neferpitou to use their En only on the outside of the palace, but Neferpitou worries that intruders might come from underground or manipulate the Ants who are permitted to come and go from the palace. Irritated, the King cuts them off and decrees Neferpitou's En shall go up only to the first floor and forbids anyone from coming to the second floor, including the Royal Guards, under pain of death.<br><br>To monitor the crowd, Neferpitou sits atop the main gate. Compelled by a feeling they cannot explain, they look up and jump on the top of the palace. Neferpitou becomes convinced that enemies are coming and extends their En upward. They rejoice upon seeing a dragon made out of aura, but an instant later, they spot two men riding it: Isaac Netero and Zeno Zoldyck. When the dragon touches their En, Neferpitou smiles upon feeling his power. They turn off their Nen to prepare for battle, but, much to their displeasure, the dragon breaks into a myriad of shards that rain down on the palace. Neferpitou is initially unable to locate the two men among the shards, but their heightened senses allow them to find Netero an instant later, whom they recognize as a far greater threat than Dragon Dive. They activate Terpsichora, but, before they can launch an attack, they think they hear Netero criticize their move and see him elegantly join his hands together; then, a tremendously fast blow strikes them from below Netero's position. Shocked, Neferpitou is launched into the distance. They try to call Shaiapouf, but the latter cannot hear them. Therefore, they activate Doctor Blythe to stop their flight and begin to drop. As they fall, they are horrified to see Dragon Dive strike the palace.<br><br>They immediately extend their En towards the palace, discovering that the King is in Komugi's room with her and that the two assassins, who located him with En, are headed there. Neferpitou curls up and jumps with all their strength the moment they touch the ground. As they soar through the air towards the tower, they feel the despair in the King's aura and has a terrible feeling. They then see his distraught expression as he clutches the wounded girl.His expression returns to normal, but Neferpitou only feels more uneasy. He orders them to heal Komugi, and upon hearing his tone, the Royal Guard cries with joy. They activate Doctor Blythe and begin treating her.<br><br>An enraged Gon arrives and demands that they restore Kite.Determined to protect Komugi, Neferpitou turns their palms upward to show they mean no harm and requests that he wait. When Gon steps closer, Neferpitou begs them to wait until they have saved her. Pressured by Gon, they explain Komugi is extremely dear to the King and offer to do anything they want after the operation is terminated. Gon, however, reacts to their words with fury. Ignoring Killua's advice, he insists on fighting. Neferpitou breaks their left arm as a sign of goodwill, offering to do the same with their other limbs and to let them do anything to them as long as it does not hinder the treatment. They look in fear as Gon prepares to attack anyway, before being stopped once again by Killua. When Gon asks them how long the operation will take, Neferpitou estimates that one hour will suffice to heal her completely,but tells him that three or four will be necessary. Gon refuses to wait that long, and Neferpitou asks for one hour to stabilize her condition. They agree to head to Peijin and restore Kite afterward.<br><br>A few minutes later, Neferpitou notices Gon has sensed Shaiapouf lurking behind him and begs him to remain where he is. They explain that if he had come any closer, Gon would have attacked Komugi. Shaiapouf attempts to move upwind to send his hypnotic scales towards Gon, but once again Gon notices and orders him to stay still. Neferpitou implores him to obey, claiming they are doing it for the King. Shaiapouf asks them what happened, intending to find out where the King is and surreptitiously warning Neferpitou that he will let Gon kill Komugi if they do not obtain the information they want. Horrified, Neferpitou agrees. They recount everything except for the King holding Komugi, not knowing how to verbalize the scene. They eventually point to the door he left through, telling Shaiapouf the King does not need their help.<br><br>Knuckle appears and demands to fight Shaiapouf. Neferpitou guesses he is about to leave the room and begs him to stop, but the Royal Guard activates Beelzebub and escapes. Neferpitou asks for forgiveness and tries to bargain with Gon, who coldly detracts ten minutes from the stipulated time limit. Since that matches the time Neferpitou felt they could save Komugi with due to improvements in the use of their Nen ability, the Royal Guard feels a sense of foreboding and begins to fear that Gon will be able to harm the King. Their suspicions become falsely confirmed when Gon tells Knuckle the King is to the south, as they didn't know Gon saw him leave. They resolve to kill him after healing Komugi but wonder who they could leave her with, as the other two Royal Guards do not care about her.<br><br>Neferpitou completes the operation before the deadline, but, despite their keeping the wound hidden from Gon's sight, the boy orders them to get up and leave. Neferpitou wonders about what else he could have guessed and if he sensed their relaxation when they finished. Komugi awakens and Neferpitou is about to formulate a request, but Gon warns them that if they speak out of turn again he will kill her. Sensing his killer intent, Neferpitou agrees to leave instead of killing him on the spot, reflecting that they will have countless occasions on the way to Peijin. However, their plans are foiled when Knuckle and Killua return and Gon uses Komugi as a hostage. Neferpitou and Gon thus run towards Peijin.<br><br>When they reach the castle where Kite's body is, Neferpitou hears the phone in their pocket vibrate and discreetly answers the call. Welfin tells them he and Bloster have rescued Komugi and lets him hear her voice. Unbeknownst to the Royal Guard, that was all a ploy concocted by Shaiapouf to get the Extermination Team to give him Komugi. Standing in front of Kite's body, Neferpitou thanks Gon for waiting and, as a reward, tells him Kite is already dead and that their ability cannot bring him back. They apologize and activate Doctor Blythe to repair their broken arm. After the broken arm has been repaired, they then declare they must kill Gon. Upon hearing this, Gon is enraged and drastically increases his aura with conditions and restrictions. Sensing Gon's tremendous aura, Neferpitou activates Terpsichora and thinks that they were right about him being a threat to the King. They attack him, but he vanishes. They give chase and see his aged form, realizing he grew up to a point where he could defeat them. Gon asks them to come outside with him since he didn't want to damage the hideout. As they walk outside, Neferpitou attacks Gon, but he dodges their attack again and kicks them into the air, then charges his Jajanken: Rock. As Neferpitou plummets back down, before they can retaliate, he punches them in the face and sends them crashing into a mountain. Before losing consciousness, Neferpitou realizes Gon will never be able to use Nen again as a result of his power-up and rejoices that they were the one to die instead of the King.<br><br>Gon continues to bash their skull until it breaks. However, Neferpitou's loyalty and devotion to the King are so great that their Nen lingered after their death; their Terpsichora, even stronger than before, manipulates Neferpitou's corpse and attacks Gon. Killua pushes Gon out of the way, causing only his arm to be severed. Gon then pins Neferpitou to the ground with the arm he lost, and uses one final attack against Neferpitou. Their motionless corpse is later shown abandoned in the woods. </div>

The Superhero Database Classification number, or SHDB Class, is a number that represents the overall 'power' of a character. All traits of a character are used for calculating the Classification.
</p>
<h5>What it DOESN'T mean</h5>
<p>
This doesn't mean that a higher class would always beat a lower class character. But the bigger the difference in Class is, the more obvious it is who'll win in a fight.
</p>
<h5>How is this calculated</h5>
<pre class="footnote">( INT^1.3 + (STR*0.5 )^2 + (SPE*0.5)^2 + DUR^1.6 + (POW + (SPS*SPL))^2 + COM^1.8 ) ^ TIER</pre>
<h6>Super Power Score and Level</h6>
<p>Every Super Power has a score (SPS) that is used to calculate the Class. Each Super Power also has 3 levels (SPL). The level is set when connecting that Super Power to a character. The level determines the final score, of the Super Power, being used in the calculation.
