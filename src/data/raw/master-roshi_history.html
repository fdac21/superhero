<h3>Master Roshi's History</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
Master Roshi, the younger brother of Fortuneteller Baba, is a martial artist trained by the great Master Mutaito a few hundred years before the beginning of Dragon Ball. He was the first one to climb the extremely tall Korin Tower and train under the legendary Korin. It took Master Roshi 3 years to catch Korin and obtain the Sacred Water, which was rumored to tremendously increase one's strength and speed.<br><br>Before King Piccolo's rampage on Earth, Master Roshi and Shen were rivals, but later on the two became friends. Together they aided their master Mutaito in his battle with King Piccolo. The three of them were no match for King Piccolo, but Mutaito used a special technique - the Evil Containment Wave - to seal him away, dying in the process. Roshi and Shen threw the electric rice cooker he was sealed in to the bottom of the ocean so that King Piccolo would never be released.<br><br>In the anime version of events, which includes some filler and altered events, the two fought side by side against King Piccolo's demons. When the two students and Mutaito lost the battle, Mutaito said to both of them that he would return someday with a way to defeat King Piccolo. After Mutaito left, Shen lost his faith in his master and reverted to his evil way of thinking, using the logic that good was not enough to defeat King Piccolo and left. Roshi, meanwhile, fled to the mountains while many more innocent people were being killed. Several years later, Mutaito returned to Roshi; by then, with a good portion of Earth's population was gone. In the second battle with King Piccolo, Master Roshi painfully witnessed his master die when Mutaito used the Evil Containment Wave technique on King Piccolo to seal him in an Electric Rice Cooker. Afterwards, Roshi dropped the Electric Rice Cooker into the deepest depths of the ocean. He would go on to establish the Turtle School based on Mutaito's teachings.<br><br>After fifty years, Master Roshi mastered a unique attack of his own invention, called the Kamehameha. He was also Gohan's and Ox-King's martial arts instructor.<br><br><h4>Emperor Pilaf Saga</h4>
After his friend the Turtle had been lost for a whole year, Roshi is taken to the people who brought him back which are a boy named Goku and a girl named Bulma. Roshi ends up giving his Flying Nimbus to Goku and is surprised that he is pure-hearted and able to ride it. Roshi also gets to see under Bulma's nightgown in exchange for his Three-Star Dragon Ball. When returning to his house he sees that Emperor Pilaf and his minions have raided his house looking for the Dragon Ball which he gave away. While Pilaf and his minions ask for help to pushing his ship back in the water to catch them, Roshi pokes a hole in it causing Pilaf to sink to the bottom of the ocean.<br><br>A few days later, Goku returns with the Ox-King's daughter Chi-Chi to borrow the Bansho Fan to put out the flames on Fire Mountain. Unfortunately for them, he threw it away when he accidentally got it messy from using it as a placemat, but decides to use Baby Gamera to fly over to Fire Mountain and put out the flames using the MAX Power Kamehameha in exchange to touch Bulma's breasts. When Roshi destroys the fire, he realizes that he accidentally put too much power into his Kamehameha and destroys Ox-King's entire castle. When he is finished putting out the flames he sees Goku deciding to try the Kamehameha on a car and destroys it. Being surprised that he can manage to do an attack that took him decades to master, Roshi decides to take Goku in as his student, after Goku is finished with his quest gathering the Dragon Balls.<br><br><h4>Tournament Saga</h4>
When Goku returns to Roshi's house to start his training, Roshi has Goku find him a female companion. After Goku fails to find him an attractive woman, a former Orin Temple student named Krillin comes and requests to train under Roshi as well. After being bribed with Dirty Magazines, Roshi decides to allow him to train under him with Goku if they can bring him a beautiful girl. They eventually bring back a girl named Launch. Roshi packs up his house in a capsule and moves the ladder over to his special Training Island. He makes Goku and Krillin wear Turtle Shells as he puts them through tough and "unique" physical training, which begins at 4:30 A.M. and includes early morning milk delivery, tilling land bare handed, construction work and even studying.<br><br>After eight months have passed, Roshi brings them to Papaya Island to participate in the annual 21st World Martial Arts Tournament and test out their strength and skill. Master Roshi enters the tournament himself in disguise as "Jackie Chun" (a parody of Jackie Chan) in order to make sure that his students will not win; he does this so that they will still feel challenged and will not become overconfident. Roshi easily wins the elimination rounds and is matched against Yamcha (one of Goku's friends from his quest finding the Dragon Balls) and defeats him with ease. Next, Roshi is matched with Krillin in the semi-final. Krillin distracts him by throwing panties into the arena, but Roshi still wins. When Goku beats Nam in his semi-final match, Roshi reads Nam's mind and helps him out by giving him a storage capsule to fill with free water for his village. In exchange, Roshi has Nam pose as Master Roshi in the crowd to convince Yamcha that Jackie Chun and Master Roshi are not the same person.<br><br>Roshi fights Goku in the final match. When Goku looks at the full moon, he turns into a Great Ape, and Roshi is forced to destroy the moon with a Kamehameha to restore Goku back to his original form. When the fight restarts, Roshi and Goku charge at each other, both kicking each other in the face, but ultimately, Roshi just barely wins, as he has slightly more energy than Goku, and his legs are longer than Goku's, so his kick did more damage. Once the tournament is over, Roshi teaches Goku that there is always someone better out there and that he should never think of himself as the best. Having said this, Roshi decides that Goku should go out into the world and begin a journey of his own.<br><br><h4>Red Ribbon Army Saga</h4>
Roshi heads back to Kame House with Krillin so they can continue training. After a few days Goku returns with Bulma to get a submarine that he let them borrow in exchange for Bulma's Micro Band. When Launch returns from getting groceries, Roshi decides to use the Micro Band to his advantage and draws her into a bath so he can spy on her but Launch transforms into her hostile state threatening to shoot him if he does not do what she says. Captain Dark of the Red Ribbon Army has his troops come to his island to retrieve the Dragon Balls that Goku left behind and to make him build a radar for the Red Ribbon Army thinking that he is a scientist that gave him the radar. Roshi easily defeats the troops and Captain Dark, although he lets one soldier leave alive. When Goku, Bulma and Krillin return, they gave Roshi an expensive diamond they found in the cave when retrieving their third Dragon Ball, as compensation for destroying his sub. Launch who is still in her bad form takes the diamond and leaves while General Blue of the Red Ribbon Army uses his psychic powers to tie up everybody while he takes the Dragon Balls and leaves a bomb to blow everybody up. They are saved when Launch returns in her good form and frees Goku to get rid of the bomb.<br><br>While the Red Ribbon Army are left being Goku's problem, Roshi has his Micro Band confiscated from Bulma because of the perverted tricks he had tried. While everybody seems to be relaxing for the time being, Bulma makes a scout plane that reveals that Goku is heading straight for the Red Ribbon Army Headquarters which they think would be suicide. Roshi has Bulma contact Yamcha and bring an airplane so they can catch up with Goku and help him in his risky fight. When they make it to the base, Goku has already defeated the Red Ribbon Army shocking Roshi even more on how powerful Goku has become. He even says that Goku could be even stronger than him.<br><br><h4>Fortuneteller Baba Saga</h4>
Roshi and the others go back to Kame House after retrieving Goku from his victory over the Red Ribbon Army. Seeing that the last Dragon Ball's location is unknown, Roshi points them in the direction of his older sister, the Fortuneteller Baba, to have her reveal the position for them. Later on Goku comes and grabs Master Roshi and Bulma and takes them to Fortuneteller Baba's Palace as part of a plan Krillin has. While Yamcha is facing See-Through the Invisible Man, Krillin pulls Bulma's shirt down showing Roshi her bare breasts causing his nose to bleed and spray onto the Invisible Man, revealing his position to Yamcha and be easily defeated. Roshi follows the rest of the gang and spectates the battles that Baba has them fight for her to tell them where the Dragon Ball is.<br><br>After being impressed with seeing Goku defeat Bandages the Mummy and Spike the Devil Man at the Devil's Toilet, Goku has to fight a mysterious fighter that seems familiar to both Goku and Roshi. Midway through the fight, Roshi figures out who it is, with Goku still not knowing. When the mysterious fighter gives up, he reveals himself to be Goku's grandpa Gohan who Baba brought back from the Other World for the day. When Goku retrieves the last ball, Roshi tells Goku to train on his own, as he will not get any stronger by training with him anymore. Bulma convinces Roshi to take on Yamcha as his student and begins training for the 22nd World Martial Arts Tournament.<br><br><h4>Tien Shinhan Saga</h4>
Three years later, Roshi enters the 22nd World Martial Arts Tournament under his alias of Jackie Chun once again. At the tournament gates, he meets his old rival, Master Shen, the Crane Hermit, who decides to enter his students because he heard the news of Roshi's students getting far in the last tournament. Jackie Chun makes it past the preliminaries and in the quarter finals is put up against Man-Wolf, who is holding a grudge against him. Man-Wolf wants revenge on Roshi due to Roshi destroying the moon in the last tournament, causing Man Wolf to stay stuck in his wolf form. Roshi easily beats him in the arena, and also takes advantage of Man-Wolf's dog like behavior, by making Man-Wolf run out of the ring in order to retrieve a bone, thus losing the match. Roshi is able to cure Man-Wolf's problem by using Krillin's head as a substitute moon.<br><br>In the semi-finals, he is put up against the Crane Hermit's star pupil, Tien Shinhan. During the fight, Roshi and Tien are almost evenly matched, with both of them landing critical hits on each other, with Roshi managing to greatly surprise Tien with his skills. However, Roshi eventually forfeits the battle (much to Tien's surprise) since Tien found out that he is really Roshi in disguise and because he had faith in Tien's abilities, so he decides that he would be a better match for his students than himself, thus retiring himself as Jackie Chun. While Tien is conflicting with the commands Master Shen gives him in the final match against Goku, Roshi convinces Tien that Master Shen's ways are not right. During Goku's match against Tien, Roshi saves Chiaotzu from Shen, who tries to kill Chiaotzu for disobeying him when Shen orders Chiaotzu to paralyze Goku and Tien so he can kill them for Tien's earlier betrayal. Roshi blasts Shen out of the Tournament area with a Kamehameha blast before Shen can inflict harm on Chiaotzu.<br><br><h4>King Piccolo Saga</h4>
When Krillin is killed after the tournament by Tambourine, Roshi is able to identify that he is a spawn of the evil demon King Piccolo that his former mentor, Master Mutaito sacrificed himself to seal away. This knowledge scares Roshi, and realizing that King Piccolo is back, Roshi decides to travel with Tien and Chiaotzu to retrieve the Dragon Balls before the demon king can. When King Piccolo finds them, Roshi knocks out Tien, to make sure in case Roshi fails, Tien is there to help. Roshi attempts to use the Evil Containment Wave on King Piccolo, but misses the Electric Rice Cooker by an inch and the technique drains his life force. It is worth noting that Roshi never used his MAX Power form in the fight against King Piccolo. Whether this was because of its increased stamina usage, him not believing it would work, or for other reasons is unknown. Roshi with his dying breath tells King Piccolo that he will eventually fail and be brought down. After Roshi finishes his speech, he falls to the ground, dying from his lack of energy. Roshi is brought back to life after Goku defeats King Piccolo and travels to The Lookout to revive Shenron.<br><br><h4>Piccolo Jr. Saga</h4>
Three years later, Master Roshi attends the 23rd World Martial Arts Tournament to cheer on his friends and watches the battle with Goku, who has been training with Kami, against the reincarnated Piccolo. He is one of the few people who stays until the end of the tournament to see Goku win the battle. After Goku stops Kami from killing Piccolo causing Kami to lament that Piccolo's existence is his fault, and for that he is no longer worthy of life, let alone to be the Earth's Guardian. But Master Roshi tells him that is not so, the world is at peace again, and Son Goku and everyone else would not be here if it was not for the Dragon Balls. This whole thing started because of just one Dragon Ball, and now the world is safe. Kami tells Goku he has a great teacher, and Goku agrees, although admits Roshi is a bit of a pervert. He is shocked along with everybody else when Goku rudely refuses Kami's offer to become Guardian of Earth and flies off with Chi-Chi on the Flying Nimbus.<br><br><h4>Saiyan Saga</h4>
Five years later Master Roshi is seen at his home with Krillin, and Bulma, waiting for their reunion with Goku and his son, Gohan. The group is soon confronted by a man named Raditz, who reveals he is Goku's brother. He also reveals to Goku that he is a Saiyan warrior and was sent to Earth when he was a baby in order to wipe out all life. Master Roshi informs the confused and shocked Goku of a story that Grandpa Gohan told him. When he was a baby he hit his head and lost his memory, thus Goku lost his violent nature and became a happy, loving boy. Raditz implores Goku to join him in conquering planets, but is refused. However, Goku's son Gohan is kidnapped in order to get Goku to cooperate. Piccolo arrives to help Goku fight, and the two go off to take down Raditz. Later, Krillin, Bulma, and Master Roshi head to the battlefield and find Goku dying, a result of sacrificing himself to kill Raditz. Piccolo informs the group that two more Saiyans will be coming to Earth in one year, and that they are far more powerful, with Piccolo taking Gohan to train for the invasion.<br><br>A year later, the Saiyans arrive and Master Roshi, Bulma, Oolong, Puar, Ox-King, and Chi-Chi watch the battle on TV. They watch Yamcha fall, but the TV network shorts out, and they are unable to watch the continuing carnage, as Tien Shinhan, Chiaotzu, and Piccolo all fall on the battlefield as well. Later they go to the battlefield to retrieve their injured friends, Krillin reveals the home world of Piccolo is a place named Namek where there are another a set of Dragon Balls that could be used to revive their fallen friends (as when Piccolo died, Kami did as well, rendering the Dragon Balls inert).<br><br><h4>Frieza Saga</h4>
Master Roshi watches as Bulma, Krillin, and Gohan blast off into space, headed for Namek. Roshi is called by Bulma after they had arrived on Namek, but revealed the horrible news that Vegeta and a stronger being named Frieza were on the planet as well. Master Roshi visits Wukong Hospital to tell Goku of the trouble on Namek. Later, Master Roshi is seen at Capsule Corporation with his friends who are worried about Goku, Gohan, and Krillin as they struggle to survive against Frieza on Namek. Later, after Chi-Chi asked Dr. Brief to build a second Capsule Corporation spaceship, she took Master Roshi, Yajirobe, Puar and Oolong with her to go to planet Namek. While Goku as a Super Saiyan was fighting Frieza, their attempts to fly were always cancelled either because of a breakdown of the spaceship or because of getting messages from the group on Namek. When Goku is revealed to have survived Namek's destruction, but refuses to come home yet, Roshi ends up yelling in frustration that Goku's reason for not returning is that he's scared of the one being that is more powerful than a Super Saiyan: Chi-Chi, Goku's wife, only for him to immediately recant the remark after Chi-Chi, overhearing the remark, starts holding a sword out with the intent of stabbing him with it.<br><br><h4>Frieza-Androids Saga</h4>
In the anime, some months later there is a party at Master Roshi's island. But they are affected by the Black Water Mist let loose by Garlic Jr. Master Roshi is seen scaring Maron, Krillin's girlfriend, she throws a lawn chair to his face, but it does nothing to the hypnotized man. Then he is kicked by Krillin in the face, throwing away his sun-glasses and launching him into the sea. They are later cured by the Sacred Water up in the Lookout, and Garlic Jr. is trapped in the Dead Zone yet again by Gohan.<br><br>Around a year later, Goku comes back to Earth. After meeting a boy who reveals himself to be the son of Vegeta and Bulma from the future, Trunks, Goku shows his friends his new technique, the Instant Transmission, by going to Kame House and stealing Roshi's sunglasses. When Krillin brings the sunglasses back to Roshi, Roshi tells him that the ghost of Goku came and stole his sunglasses.<br><br><h4>Androids Saga</h4>
Three years later Master Roshi is at his house with Oolong and Chiaotzu as they await the news regarding the battle with the Androids.

Seven years after the defeat of Cell, Master Roshi is told by Gohan that Goku will be returning to Earth to attend the 25th World Martial Arts Tournament. Master Roshi attends the tournament to cheer on his friends. The appearance of Babidi changes the course of events, and after Vegeta is taken over by the wizard, he kills hundreds of people at the tournament in order to get Goku to fight him. Master Roshi goes with the others to look for the Dragon Balls in order to revive those killed by Vegeta.<br><br><h4>Majin Buu Saga</h4>
However, a much larger threat surfaces when Babidi's monster Majin Buu is released. He later takes refuge from Majin Buu on The Lookout.

Master Roshi attends Bulma's Universe 7 victory party with his friends and learns that Monaka isn't a fighter. He then watches as Beerus dons a life-sized Monaka costume and fights with Goku, and later starts the party with Monaka's secret protected.<br><br><h4>"Future" Trunks Saga</h4>
Master Roshi teaches Goku the Evil Containment Wave as a mean to defeat Future Zamasu. However, Roshi later calls Bulma to tell her that Goku forgot to take the seal to the future timeline, preventing them from sealing Zamasu.<br><br><h4>Universe Survival Saga</h4>
Knowing it is a tournament that isn't purely about power but team work and strategy as well, Gohan recommends Master Roshi as a member of Team Universe 7, saying his massive experience and enormous bag of tricky attacks will be extremely useful. Goku agrees saying Master Roshi can easily hold his own with his special moves alone. Roshi shows up to Yamcha's home as the latter is watching TV. Yamcha thinks Roshi is inviting him to join the team, but Roshi is only here to get Puar to transform into a young woman. Roshi claims that he is doing this because he wants to overcome his perversion before the tournament starts, but Yamcha isn't so sure it will work.<br><br>Oolong already refused to help Roshi so the latter turns to Puar. After a short while, Master Roshi finally overcame his weakness and heads to Korin's tower for some training. He soon meet up with the others at Capsule Corp. realizing that Majin Buu has fallen alseep, as he listens on as Goku and Beerus discuss the new 10th member, he and the rest of the Universe 7 team were shocked when his former student suggested bringing Frieza back to life.<br><br>After Goku returns with Frieza, Master Roshi and the others are transported by Whis to the Null Realm. While at the Tournament of Power, Krillin asked him would he be okay when seeing the two females Caulifla and Kale, the turtle hermit assured him and Tien Shinhan that he will be fine. The Battle Royal starts and Master Roshi chooses to stay alongside Gohan, Piccolo, Krillin, and Tien Shinhan, he and the others are cornered by Lavender, Botamo, Comfrey, Shosa and Dercori; the team launched their assault (with Master Roshi firing the Kamehameha), which did little to no damage. Later after Krillin damages Zium's wing with his Destructo Disc, Roshi blasts Zium out of the arena with his version of the Kamehameha. After Kale's rampage, Master Roshi runs into Za Priccio, whom he traps with his Thunder Shock Surprise, and Tien knocks him out with the Neo Tri-Beam. He regroups with the other members of Team Universe 7. Seeing the situation of the tournament, Gohan, Piccolo, Tien and Master Roshi decide to fight separately, dodging a Ki Blast from K'nsi.<br><br>After completely scoping out everything since the tournament begin, Master Roshi ventures off on his own, while analyzing the status of the remaining fighters; he is soon confronted by three of the Universe 4 fighters; the first was Caway (whom was trying to seduce him), but her efforts backfired as he chased her off the stage; the second was Dercori (whom used her talismans to trap him in an illusion), Master Roshi successfully sealed her inside a jar with the Evil Containment Wave and tossed it off-stage (with both Omni-Kings allowing the jar, saying it was neat); the third and final opponent was Ganos, who transformed in order to fight Roshi. Initially Master Roshi was overwhelming him, but was overpowered when the latter increased in power. Left with no other option, Master Roshi uses up all of his energy to knock Ganos out of the arena with a Life Force MAX Power Kamehameha while at the same time, reminiscing the things he had learned from Goku and Krillin, as well as their time spent together. He almost died until Goku revived him with some of his energy, afterwards the two head off together.<br><br>Master Roshi sits down on a rock, Goku asks him if he will be fine. Roshi tells him that he will be fine with some rest. Roshi then tells Goku to go on and fight for him. Goku then departs. Roshi is next seen resting and hiding in a rock circle recovering and laminating how recovering was easier when he was younger. He is then attacked by Frost and is battered around thanks to being tired and their power gap. Roshi calls out Frost on going after weakened and tired fighters and Frost begins to torture his newly injured left shoulder. Frost mentions its not fun if they can't fight back and goes to eliminate Roshi but Roshi unleashes his Full Power and manages to push Frost back for a few moments but is overpowered. Frost says that it's hard for him to fight here as he has to be careful not to kill him by accident and blasts him with several Chaos Shots.<br><br>Roshi, having been blasted back to his base form, uses the Evil Containment Wave again and almost manages to seal Frost; still, his injured shoulder prevents him from aiming properly. Frost, horrified at Roshi for having such a useful attack, forgets the rules and tries to kill Roshi, but Vegeta steps in and saves him, mentioning that he isn't saving him, it's just Frost pisses him off. Roshi sits back and lets Vegeta handle Frost and the now present Augo Magetta. When Frost mentions that he can't beat him in a normal convention, Roshi goes for the Evil Containment Wave again, trying to seal both Frost and Magetta; however, Frost uses a reflection to gain control. Vegeta rushes in to save Roshi once again, but Beerus sees through the trap and tells Vegeta to move, but it is too late and Vegeta is hit by and sealed away. Roshi, refusing to let Vegeta get eliminated thanks to him, charges and is easily blown back by Frost and shot with more Chaos Shots.<br><br>In a last ditch effort, Roshi fires a very small ki blast at the jar and seems to miss. Frost mocks Roshi's attempt, but Roshi shows he actually can use the attack like the Spirit Ball and redirects it back to blast the jar open, freeing an enraged Vegeta, who comes out as a Super Saiyan Blue and blasts the custom rock made hearing protectors off of Magetta and calls him a bastard, which makes him curl up into a ball. Frost retreats as Vegeta casually rolls Magetta off the stage. Roshi apologizes to Vegeta, to which he doesn't answer and instead asks Roshi to retire and eliminate himself before he dies from exhaustion. Roshi, realizing that Vegeta is right, agrees with him reluctantly. Vegeta then promises Roshi that he will take care of everything else as he has done enough. Roshi, leaving the rest of the fight to Vegeta, allows himself to pass out and fall out of the ring. Tien and Krillin catch Roshi and give him a Senzu Bean, reviving him. Beerus, while initially appearing to be angry, reveals that he is only joking and says the three did very well given the situation and, in a rare show of respect from the God of Destruction, Beerus calls Roshi "Master". </div>

<p>
The Superhero Database Classification number, or SHDB Class, is a number that represents the overall 'power' of a character. All traits of a character are used for calculating the Classification.
</p>
<h5>What it DOESN'T mean</h5>
<p>
This doesn't mean that a higher class would always beat a lower class character. But the bigger the difference in Class is, the more obvious it is who'll win in a fight.
</p>
<h5>How is this calculated</h5>
<pre class="footnote">( INT^1.3 + (STR*0.5 )^2 + (SPE*0.5)^2 + DUR^1.6 + (POW + (SPS*SPL))^2 + COM^1.8 ) ^ TIER</pre>
<h6>Super Power Score and Level</h6>
<p>Every Super Power has a score (SPS) that is used to calculate the Class. Each Super Power also has 3 levels (SPL). The level is set when connecting that Super Power to a character. The level determines the final score, of the Super Power, being used in the calculation.
